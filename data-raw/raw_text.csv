The bifurcated leadership pattern specific to Ojibwe society has been discussed in detail by the anthropologist Harold Hickerson. Hickerson notes that the “interplay of the civil authority and the military segment, the warriors,” was multi-faceted and complex. He characterized the relationship as “simultaneously one of solidarity and opposition.” Warrior opposition to the civil leaders' policy decisions was most likely to arise when issues “relating to war and peace” were involved. Generally, the civil leaders counseled peace, and the warriors, frequently referred to in historical sources as the ‘young men,’ advocated continuing hostilities. Descriptions in the documentary record of this pattern, Hickerson notes, “are legion.” Yet the warriors did not form a permanent political opposition, “a genuine political faction,” within Ojibwe communities. In addition to their role as warriors, these men had other, equally important, social roles that integrated them into their communities, provided recognition and prestige, and gave them shared interest with the civil leaders in community survival. The warriors were also hunters, the “chief providers” for their villages; they were enmeshed in family and kinship networks; often they were heads of households. These multiple roles, Hickerson argues, mitigated divisive tendencies and encouraged solidarity between warriors and civil leaders based on an overarching mutual interest in community survival. 13Hickerson does not explore the reasoning that lay behind the Ojibwe's leadership duality, noting that “there was no absolute reason for different kinds of leadership to be invested in different men.” However, in his discussion of the civil leader/warrior opposition he suggests an important consideration. Commenting upon the numerous instances of the civil leaders advocating peaceful solutions and the warriors pressing for military action, Hickerson speculates that this “patterned behavior” reflected Ojibwe expectations of elders and youths in their society: “wisdom was the obligation of the older civil leaders, and recklessness the prerogative of the young.” Indeed, the Ojibwe not only had different expectations of the two groups; they recognized two distinct leadership styles. 14"																															970.2	Yes: War chief here	"A band was a self-contained unit small enough to find food yet large enough to protect itself from enemy attacks. It had a leader recognized as the political chief; another man was the war chief. During normal times the political chief controlled the movements of the band, but should there be danger from enemy attack or other causes, the war chief immediately assumed control.The political chief took the role of chief magistrate, presiding at council meetings, giving instructions to the camp police, and setting disputes within the band. His police were members of one of the warrior societies.When a boy reached his early teens he joined one of these societies made up of comrades his own age. Then, about once every five years, his society took over the membership of the group that was older than themselves and transferred their membership to a new group of younger persons. In this way every man in the camp could belong to a society of people his own age. Those who were between twenty and twenty-five, or between twenty-five and thirty, were most often chosen to act as camp police. They patrolled at night, acted as guardians during buffalo hunts, and protected the band while on the trail. They also carried out the edicts of punishment decided by the chief. For example, a thief might be banished from the camp, or a man who went out alone to hunt buffalo and frightened the herds away might have had his horse seized and his riding gear destroyed."																															991.1	Yes: War chief here	"Insofar as the chiefs were concerned, a war chief was generally of his own making and he might or might not have much influence in the tribe; there were many war chiefs in every Indian band, and each one was subject to fall from favor should his medicine fail to work and his followers (who might be only a few of his own relatives or clan members) take a drubbing by the enemy. War chief was a step in the right direction, though, and if a war chief displayed consistent qualities of wisdom and good judgment as well as bravery he might well earn the position of band chief or civil chief, who was the real leader of the tribe."																															1160.2	Yes: War chief here	"An institutional chiefdom with a definitely established succession prevails in both tribes. If the chief dies, his next younger brother automatically takes his place. Only if the youngest brother is dead may the first-born son of the oldest brother, who by that time is usually an older man, occupy the office of chief. In addition there is the war chief. This position is not hereditary; rather, the bravest warrior is chosen for it. During peacetimes he has no prerogatives whatever and lives like an ordinary member of the tribe. Only during military encounters does he take over the leadership, while the real chief, as religious head, doctor, and teacher, is protected and does not take part; the same is true for his brothers."																															1032.1	Yes: Village chief here	"The Hopi do have a village chief, the kikmongwi, but his principal role is to maintain harmony between the village and the spiritual world. His council, composed of men who inherit their positions through their clans (having been selected and trained by the [Page 254] previous incumbent), serves more as an advisory group than as a legislative or judicial body. The focus of community life is the ceremonial system, and the individual ceremonies are under the control of mongwi, or leaders, who inherit their positions through their clans. (Some of these mongwi are on the council.) While some clans are more important than others, in that they “own” the more important ceremonies, there is no rigid hierarchy. As we have seen in the discussion of domestic life, authority is not a principle of social interaction of kin; similarly, it is not a principle of social interaction within the community. The principles that are discussed by the Hopi and observable in action are the acceptance of duty and cooperation toward common goals. Whatever authority is exerted by community leaders is directed at the coordination of effort, not at enforcement of unilateral decisions. Resolution of conflicts is essentially a private matter between the parties involved; and conflicts that cannot be handled privately either break the village apart, as happened when Oraibi split in 1906, or simply persist for years or even generations."																															906.1	Yes: Traiding post leader here	"“Inside” and “outside” leaders are discernible among Ojibwa bands living on the north shore of Lake Superior in the mid-19th century. The traditional forms of leadership — hunting group leader and band chief — were still present and the fur trade had provided an opportunity for a new leadership role to appear, that of trading post band chief. He was, as his title suggests, attached to a trading post and was credited by the trader with having considerable authority over the members of the trading post band (Rogers 1965). As an “outside” leader, the trading post band chief was noted for his ability to deal with non-natives and was highly regarded by them, but the status thus afforded him was not necessarily recognized by all the members of the trading post band, nor did his authority extend to activities outside the trading post."																															1021.2	Yes: Sub chief here	"The hereditary chief held the highest rank in Pawnee society. Succession was always patrilineal, usually passing to the eldest son. However, the direct heir might decline the responsibility or he might be unfit for the office. In either case another male relative who was better suited for the position could fill it. Enjoying slightly less prestige were the subchiefs. They did not inherit their positions but were elected to them. Most came from prominent families, although many were commoners who had distinguished themselves in war and on the hunt and who exhibited the chiefly traits of generosity and self-restraint. Once elected, a chief was given a permanent seat in the chiefs’ council and occupied it until his death."																															888.2	Yes: Shaman here	"The noticeable lack of centralized authority in Inuit society, especially among the Copper Eskimo, made the enforcement of these protolegal postulates a difficult task. In other areas of the Arctic, such as North Alaska, a local headman might be consulted in civil disputes (Spencer 1959:178). His influence, however, was suggestive, not binding, and thus there was no coercive authority for the enforcement of cultural values and norms. In many areas of the Arctic, shamans had the power to coerce, but this was done mostly out of fear rather than the recognition of institutionalized authority. Depending upon the disposition of the shaman and the extent of his perceived powers, the shaman could use his supernatural abilities to maintain the social balance of the community or, alternately, simply to advance his own power and control."																															1187.2	Yes: Shaman here	"Each village or long house where the Tupí-Guaraní Indians extended their hammocks was headed by a patrilineal chief called [unknown]nander[unknown]u or tuvichá . As the population grew, a cacique or a powerful shaman, who had to be an eloquent orator or great warrior, sometimes emerged to rule over several segmented villages. 13 These were not, however, sociopolitical tribes. Each tribe belonged to a gu[unknown]ara, a region with specific territorial limits, each with its own fields and hunting grounds. These geographical regions were impassable without the Indians’ permission. These were relatively egalitarian societies, at least for the men. The Tupí-Guaraní were patrilineal societies. 14 Most of the tribes were polygamous, although some were monogamous. A tuvichá usually had more than one wife which was a symbol of prestige. Knowledge of sexuality among the Tupí-Guaraní is extremely limited because missionaries, by convention, were rather prudish in writing about this subject. Women, unlike men, faced death if caught committing adultery. However, it was easy for both men or women to obtain a divorce from their spouses. Couples simply separated and went their own way. 15"																															1195.2	Yes: Priest here	"The priest (mama) exercises the principal authority (pl. 181, top, left ), although under Spanish influence each village has a secular headman or commissioner. The latter, however, refers important questions to the priest for final decision. The headman of the village usually serves for 1 or 2 years to be succeeded by another wealthy or influential individual."																															970.1	Yes: Political leader here	"A band was a self-contained unit small enough to find food yet large enough to protect itself from enemy attacks.

He ascribes his power and his influence to the fact that he knows how to interpret the instructions that the ancestors-gods give in all sorts of signs. If one does not obey the tadoelako, then one is rebelling against the gods. It is not primarily courage that is asked of the tadoelako, but knowledge of all sorts of signs that appear and the interpretation of them. We have known tadoelako who were not courageous, but were respected by everyone because of their great knowledge and wisdom.In larger groups of warriors there were usually two tadoelako, one of whom had the leadership of the expedition and the other was in command during the attack; the latter had to be a courageous man, but he, too, had to follow the instructions of the first one. The first one was the tadoelako mpoe’oe or tadoelako kodjo , “the true tadoelako”; also sometimes called wo’o ntangoa , “the head of the huts,” or wo’o ntaoe , “the head of the men.” The second one was the tadoelako iwinja , “someone with whom (in what concerns the leadership) one does not reckon”; or tadoelako ri tana , “tadoelako of the ground,” in contrast to the abode of the gods in the sky with /260/ which the chief-tadoelako is connected. Another name for him was kongka , “eagle”; he is celebrated as such in the war songs. Sometimes a Chief ( mokole ) also went out with the troop; he then usually acted as a second [Page 386] tadoelako. For the most part, however, the village chief did not go with the troop, but remained at home in order to look out for the well-being of those who remained behind. If he went along, he also had to follow the instructions of the first tadoelako."																															1132.2	Yes: Local leader here	"The political organization of the Makuna is egalitarian, in the sense that there is no permanent, centralized authority. Each residence group has a headman ( [unknown]uh[unknown]u ). He is the owner of the house, the man who was responsible for the joint undertaking of building it. He is usually, but not necessarily, the eldest son of the previous headman. The headman is always an adult, married and able-bodied man, never very old nor physically weak or handicapped. As the owner, his task is to see that the house is maintained in a proper state and repaired when needed. As headman of the residence group inhabiting the longhouse, his duty is to keep peace and order in the group and to maintain good relations with other groups. Thus, he represents his group in all external relations. He is ultimately responsible for the well-being of his followers. It is thus also his duty to see that his followers are well fed and properly married. His rights are few and are directly tied to his responsibilities. His authority is consequently limited. It rests on his status as house-owner and his ability to lead his followers by means of hard work, good behaviour and skilful talk. He has no coercive or commanding authority. In short, his authority and the sanctions at his disposal are those of a “social director”: he convinces, advises and organizes, and he interprets and directs public opinion.A prestigious and ambitious headman may extend his authority and political influence outside his own residence group. Then he becomes what I shall call a local leader, whose authority is accepted and recognized by several headman. Yet he will still be referred to as [unknown]uh[unknown]u, that is, headman and house-owner. The authority of a local leader does not rest on his status as house-owner and senior kinsman alone, but on his control over other and additional political resources, as well as on his political skill and charismatic personality. His rights and duties are a direct extension of those of the headman. The limits of his authority are set by his own prestige and capacity, as well as by the segmentary social and political system in which he operates."																															906.2	Yes: Hunting group leader here	"“Inside” and “outside” leaders are discernible among Ojibwa bands living on the north shore of Lake Superior in the mid-19th century.

His leadership was based on his age, knowledge and skills as a hunter, perhaps also on his reputation as a shaman, and he fulfilled his role as leader through his ingenuity, personality and his enjoyment of the group's approval. On those occasions when the band's hunting groups collected, its members recognized the leadership of a single individual headman, a chief whose role as leader was weaker than that of a hunting group headman and who was recognized only until the band dispersed once again. ----A chief's authority was based on his age, his oratorical skills and his ability to act as an arbitrator among band members and, following contact, between them and Europeans. Since the Lake Superior Ojibwa spent most of the year scattered in hunting groups, headmen would have had more influence over their daily activities than did chiefs."																															1021.1	Yes: Hereditary chief	"The hereditary chief held the highest rank in Pawnee society.

In the ordinary everyday affairs of the Tikopia clan the ultimate decisive role is played by the chief. His word is effective, and is normally not questioned. Affairs between clans are decided by the chiefs in concert, with great display of courteous agreement. Seconding the efforts of the chief in each clan are his elders ( pure or matapure ), who are the heads of the various major ramages. They attain their position primarily by seniority of descent, but they must be confirmed in office by their clan chief, and in some twin ramages which continue to maintain a close relationship for generations after the point of branching the chief may select the joint elder alternately from one and then the other ramage. The role of the elder is, however, in essence a ritual one. His main task is to conduct the worship of the gods and ancestral spirits on behalf of the group he represents and to perform the appropriate rituals in connexion with sickness, sea voyaging, &c. This ritual function is symbolized by his investiture by the chief on election with a leaf necklet regarded as endowed with magical virtue. The elder exercises authority by right over all members of his ramage and obtains respect from the community at large. His position is analogous to, and in some degree is the outcome of, that of a father in the family. The Tikopia elder can, in fact, be regarded as fulfilling in part the role of a father-symbol to his ramage, just as the chief fills a similar role for his clan. But the elders may play a comparatively small part in general social control in the community. They are ranked in a ritual hierarchy in each clan according to the importance of the gods they serve, and only a few of the highest ranking ones play much part in the maintenance of public order."																															630.2	Yes: code village headman here	"The head of the Khasi State is the Siem or chief.

In the Khasi Hills there is no land revenue, nor are there any tithes or other imposts levied upon the cultivator's produce. The land, to a great extent, is the property of the different clans and villages, although in some instances there are estates owned by private persons. The chief is entitled to receive the income that arises from what are known as the raj or State lands only. All that the Siem usually receives from his people in the way of direct revenue is the State subscription, or pynsuk , mentioned above. Even this is supposed to be a voluntary contribution, and it is not demanded in some States.

The Siem's principal source of income, however, in all the Khasi States is the toll ( khrong ), which he takes from those who sell at the markets in his territory.

When the crofters must select a leader, from their own number, the status is accorded to an elder of the church. The elder already has high status because of his advanced age and his position in the kirk.

He ascribes his power and his influence to the fact that he knows how to interpret the instructions that the ancestors-gods give in all sorts of signs. If one does not obey the tadoelako, then one is rebelling against the gods. It is not primarily courage that is asked of the tadoelako, but knowledge of all sorts of signs that appear and the interpretation of them. We have known tadoelako who were not courageous, but were respected by everyone because of their great knowledge and wisdom.In larger groups of warriors there were usually two tadoelako, one of whom had the leadership of the expedition and the other was in command during the attack; the latter had to be a courageous man, but he, too, had to follow the instructions of the first one. The first one was the tadoelako mpoe’oe or tadoelako kodjo , “the true tadoelako”; also sometimes called wo’o ntangoa , “the head of the huts,” or wo’o ntaoe , “the head of the men.” The second one was the tadoelako iwinja , “someone with whom (in what concerns the leadership) one does not reckon”; or tadoelako ri tana , “tadoelako of the ground,” in contrast to the abode of the gods in the sky with /260/ which the chief-tadoelako is connected. Another name for him was kongka , “eagle”; he is celebrated as such in the war songs. Sometimes a Chief ( mokole ) also went out with the troop; he then usually acted as a second [Page 386] tadoelako. For the most part, however, the village chief did not go with the troop, but remained at home in order to look out for the well-being of those who remained behind.

The bifurcated leadership pattern specific to Ojibwe society has been discussed in detail by the anthropologist Harold Hickerson. Hickerson notes that the “interplay of the civil authority and the military segment, the warriors,” was multi-faceted and complex. He characterized the relationship as “simultaneously one of solidarity and opposition.” Warrior opposition to the civil leaders' policy decisions was most likely to arise when issues “relating to war and peace” were involved. Generally, the civil leaders counseled peace, and the warriors, frequently referred to in historical sources as the ‘young men,’ advocated continuing hostilities. Descriptions in the documentary record of this pattern, Hickerson notes, “are legion.” Yet the warriors did not form a permanent political opposition, “a genuine political faction,” within Ojibwe communities. In addition to their role as warriors, these men had other, equally important, social roles that integrated them into their communities, provided recognition and prestige, and gave them shared interest with the civil leaders in community survival. The warriors were also hunters, the “chief providers” for their villages; they were enmeshed in family and kinship networks; often they were heads of households. These multiple roles, Hickerson argues, mitigated divisive tendencies and encouraged solidarity between warriors and civil leaders based on an overarching mutual interest in community survival. 13Hickerson does not explore the reasoning that lay behind the Ojibwe's leadership duality, noting that “there was no absolute reason for different kinds of leadership to be invested in different men.” However, in his discussion of the civil leader/warrior opposition he suggests an important consideration. Commenting upon the numerous instances of the civil leaders advocating peaceful solutions and the warriors pressing for military action, Hickerson speculates that this “patterned behavior” reflected Ojibwe expectations of elders and youths in their society: “wisdom was the obligation of the older civil leaders, and recklessness the prerogative of the young.” Indeed, the Ojibwe not only had different expectations of the two groups; they recognized two distinct leadership styles. 14"																															1187.1	"Yes: Chief, tuvicha here"	"Each village or long house where the Tupí-Guaraní Indians extended their hammocks was headed by a patrilineal chief called [unknown]nander[unknown]u or tuvichá . As the population grew, a cacique or a powerful shaman, who had to be an eloquent orator or great warrior, sometimes emerged to rule over several segmented villages. 13 These were not, however, sociopolitical tribes. Each tribe belonged to a gu[unknown]ara, a region with specific territorial limits, each with its own fields and hunting grounds. These geographical regions were impassable without the Indians’ permission. These were relatively egalitarian societies, at least for the men. The Tupí-Guaraní were patrilineal societies. 14 Most of the tribes were polygamous, although some were monogamous. A tuvichá usually had more than one wife which was a symbol of prestige. Knowledge of sexuality among the Tupí-Guaraní is extremely limited because missionaries, by convention, were rather prudish in writing about this subject. Women, unlike men, faced death if caught committing adultery. However, it was easy for both men or women to obtain a divorce from their spouses. Couples simply separated and went their own way. 15"																															907.2	Yes: Chief here	"Within a hunting group, the senior male member was most often recognized as headman of the group. His leadership was based on his age, knowledge and skills as a hunter, perhaps also on his reputation as a shaman, and he fulfilled his role as leader through his ingenuity, personality and his enjoyment of the group's approval. On those occasions when the band's hunting groups collected, its members recognized the leadership of a single individual headman, a chief whose role as leader was weaker than that of a hunting group headman and who was recognized only until the band dispersed once again. ----A chief's authority was based on his age, his oratorical skills and his ability to act as an arbitrator among band members and, following contact, between them and Europeans. Since the Lake Superior Ojibwa spent most of the year scattered in hunting groups, headmen would have had more influence over their daily activities than did chiefs."																															1109.1	Yes: chief here	"The first set of data concerns the structure of authority. In the ordinary everyday affairs of the Tikopia clan the ultimate decisive role is played by the chief. His word is effective, and is normally not questioned. Affairs between clans are decided by the chiefs in concert, with great display of courteous agreement. Seconding the efforts of the chief in each clan are his elders ( pure or matapure ), who are the heads of the various major ramages. They attain their position primarily by seniority of descent, but they must be confirmed in office by their clan chief, and in some twin ramages which continue to maintain a close relationship for generations after the point of branching the chief may select the joint elder alternately from one and then the other ramage. The role of the elder is, however, in essence a ritual one. His main task is to conduct the worship of the gods and ancestral spirits on behalf of the group he represents and to perform the appropriate rituals in connexion with sickness, sea voyaging, &c. This ritual function is symbolized by his investiture by the chief on election with a leaf necklet regarded as endowed with magical virtue. The elder exercises authority by right over all members of his ramage and obtains respect from the community at large. His position is analogous to, and in some degree is the outcome of, that of a father in the family. The Tikopia elder can, in fact, be regarded as fulfilling in part the role of a father-symbol to his ramage, just as the chief fills a similar role for his clan. But the elders may play a comparatively small part in general social control in the community. They are ranked in a ritual hierarchy in each clan according to the importance of the gods they serve, and only a few of the highest ranking ones play much part in the maintenance of public order."																															1160.1	Yes: Chief here	"An institutional chiefdom with a definitely established succession prevails in both tribes. If the chief dies, his next younger brother automatically takes his place. Only if the youngest brother is dead may the first-born son of the oldest brother, who by that time is usually an older man, occupy the office of chief. In addition there is the war chief. This position is not hereditary; rather, the bravest warrior is chosen for it. During peacetimes he has no prerogatives whatever and lives like an ordinary member of the tribe. Only during military encounters does he take over the leadership, while the real chief, as religious head, doctor, and teacher, is protected and does not take part; the same is true for his brothers."																															1148.1	Yes: Chief edu here	"After Edu won the election, it soon became clear that the power structure at Curideri was far from settled.

His council, composed of men who inherit their positions through their clans (having been selected and trained by the [Page 254] previous incumbent), serves more as an advisory group than as a legislative or judicial body. The focus of community life is the ceremonial system, and the individual ceremonies are under the control of mongwi, or leaders, who inherit their positions through their clans. (Some of these mongwi are on the council.) While some clans are more important than others, in that they “own” the more important ceremonies, there is no rigid hierarchy. As we have seen in the discussion of domestic life, authority is not a principle of social interaction of kin; similarly, it is not a principle of social interaction within the community. The principles that are discussed by the Hopi and observable in action are the acceptance of duty and cooperation toward common goals. Whatever authority is exerted by community leaders is directed at the coordination of effort, not at enforcement of unilateral decisions. Resolution of conflicts is essentially a private matter between the parties involved; and conflicts that cannot be handled privately either break the village apart, as happened when Oraibi split in 1906, or simply persist for years or even generations."																															991.2	Yes: Band chief 	"Insofar as the chiefs were concerned, a war chief was generally of his own making and he might or might not have much influence in the tribe; there were many war chiefs in every Indian band, and each one was subject to fall from favor should his medicine fail to work and his followers (who might be only a few of his own relatives or clan members) take a drubbing by the enemy. War chief was a step in the right direction, though, and if a war chief displayed consistent qualities of wisdom and good judgment as well as bravery he might well earn the position of band chief or civil chief, who was the real leader of the tribe."																															603	No	"The arrangement was also to the landlord's advantage. As the official leader, he wielded greater power by which he could more easily manipulate the villagers, and even the tax collector, to his own advantage. His recognition as a leader by his fellow villagers and by the authorities also increased his prestige.Not only was such a landlord the elected village political leader but he might often be an informal leader as well, a person who took an active part in most of the social and religious affairs of the village. He usually contributed money and time to help make these affairs a success. The efforts of the landlord helped to build up his reputation as a public-spirited citizen. Frequently, he assumed the role of mediator in discussions of village and intervillage problems and in disputes between his own villagers or even between members of other villages. When the landlord's efforts as a mediator extended beyond his own village, he enhanced his own reputation in the whole area and that of his village as well.Today, the landlord class continues in the rural area and wields power in local grass roots polities as well as in socioeconomic affairs. In most villages the recognized leaders are still those who are rich, maintain big landholdings, and have had a fairly good education. Such people may also have influence -- perhaps by virtue of a relative -- in some government agency. It is still a great advantage to a village to have a wealthy representative of the landlord class to deal successfully with authorities. Many, if not most of the government officials, are drawn from this class, since they are educated and usually wealthy."																															18	No	"A kingdom was divided up into provinces, each governed by a chief, who was usually a younger brother or son of the king. Faithful followers such as generals or, occasionally, a conquered chief, might be appointed to these positions, but they did not thereby become Avungara. Every chief had to be personally installed in his office by the king, but there was no ceremony, merely formal approval. 3Sometimes, 4 if his kingdom became very large, a king would divide it during his lifetime between two or three of his sons or brothers, who, while remaining subject to their father, would have absolute authority over their own chiefs. Or the sons themselves might become independent or have such large chiefdoms that they had to appoint sub-chiefs of their own in order to administer their domains effectively. Such a chiefdom was, in fact, a separate kingdom, and only nominal allegiance was owed to the king. Azande did not think of states as having a permanence apart from their rulers; they thought rather in terms of a particular number of people living in a particular area and owing personal allegiance to a particular Vungara; and of individuals as subjects of a king, rather than members of a group. Such a relationship existed between Bazingbi and his son, Wando, each of whom, for all effective purposes, had a separate kingdom, although Wando gave nominal allegiance to his father. 5The pattern of authority between king and chief in a large kingdom was not strictly formalized; the size of a chiefdom was limited by the criterion of administrative efficiency and it was possible for one or more intermediate authorities to exist between a chief and his king. A commoner holding one of these intermediate positions, however high he might rise, could very seldom achieve a higher position [Page 49] in the political hierarchy than the lowest Avungara. There is only one recorded exception to this rule. 6"																															19	No	"In the old days, under a king who was very strong, there was a constant tendency for Avungara chiefs to throw off their allegiance, particularly at succession times, and found kingdoms of their own by conquering their neighbours. This process of fission with addition was the method by which the Zande Empire was enlarged. The king’s eldest son was his legal successor provided he was certainly legitimate and had been nominated by his father before his death. The designate would, in the normal course of events, already be a chief with a province and warriors of his own, but usually he would have brothers in the same position, and succession wars were a regular occurrence in Zande political life. These interregnums lasted until one claimant had established himself by slaying his rivals, or driving them out to find fresh kingdoms of their own elsewhere, or until, owing to mutual exhaustion, there was tacit agreement to split the kingdom. Each party would then look to extend his territory at the expense of his other neighbours. Possession [Page 50] of the field and a simple declaration were sufficient to establish sovereignty, though customarily there were appropriate celebrations and dancing. Wars of this sort helped to cement the feudal type of society which the Avungara had established. In such times all commoners and minor chiefs required an overlord to protect them and accept their service.In several of the accounts it is not clear whether the ruler referred to should be classified as a king or a chief: on many occasions—for instance, when courts are described—the distinction is unimportant. Each king had a home chiefdom, as it were, personally administered by himself, in addition to those ruled by the chiefs who owed allegiance to him."																															20	No	"The boundaries between chiefdoms are usually marked by streams or other natural features; the importance of a chief is estimated by the number of his subjects, not by the area he happens to govern. An idea of the size and composition of chiefdoms can be gathered from J. E. T. Phillips, 1313 MS. “Notes on Sudan Administration.”who states that when the Tembura District of Bahr el Ghazal (now Equatoria) Province was put under European administration, there were six well-established chiefdoms with a total population of 65,000, few of whom were Azande proper, and seven separate languages were spoken in the area. Schweinfurth 1414 1873, vol. II, p. 22. Footnote.states that there were 35 independent chiefs within the 48,000 square miles visited by Khartoum merchants, very few of whom deserved the title of king."																															21	No	"Commoner Azande soon forget their own descent and do not bother to go back farther than their great-grandfathers: 2020 This lack of interest is related to the unimportance of the clan system.yet they remember the genealogies and myths which confirm the legitimacy of their chiefs, because it is through them that their common feelings of political unity are expressed. Each chief stands for his own chiefdom, in that his followers will describe themselves as “Tembura’s Man” or “Gangara’s Man”; and there was a similar relationship between king and chief. As, therefore, the existence of each political unit is dependent on a series of personal relationships, and is only secure while the same political head exists, the political relationship is expressed in personal terms. But only legitimate Avungara may be chiefs, so that not only are Avungara the political leaders of the society, but also, as a group, they constitute the permanent principle and enduring symbol of the historical continuity of the Azande. There are no sacred drums, beads, stools, or other insignia, which function as national symbols and possess in themselves a virtue superior to the chief’s. The Avungara dynasty created the Zande nation and through them the Zande nation is perpetuated."																															22	No	"A king or chief attracts a host of dependants and has many wives, but his residence only differs from that of his subjects in the much larger number of its huts, the quality of its furnishings and in its division into private and public parts, separated from each other at least by a grass screen and sometimes by a large expanse of ground. The area covered could be very large and it was estimated that King Gbudwe’s court extended over five square miles. 2222 Larken, 1927, p. 129.Mangbetu chiefs in their glory seem to have enjoyed all the privileges of the Avungara to an excessive degree and to have been more wealthy and dictatorial. Indeed Schweinfurth states: “The Monbuttoo potentates enjoy far more prerogatives than the Niam-Niam princes.” 2323 1873, vol. II, pp. 96-7.But the actual organization of their provinces and their legal powers were almost identical, and they resembled Avungara chiefs temporarily writ large."																															23	No	"Traditionally there was no formal system of land tenure; the right to work land depended on customary possession and use and, as there was plenty of land for the clearing, the chief had no real control over it, although nominally all land belonged to him. Chiefs, apparently, never possessed any ritual responsibility for their land, and therefore had no ritual claims upon it. Occasionally a chief might order rain-making ceremonies 5353 See Evans-Pritchard, 21, 1936, p. 21.to be performed but this was part of his general responsibility for the welfare of his people, and was not due to any ritual virtue with which he was endowed."																															24	No	"The dues which a chief received were of three types: first, labour and service: the palanga had to hoe his gardens, and all his subjects were expected to supply materials for and build his homesteads. 54 Secondly, there were standard dues—ivory, a portion of every beast killed, a quantity of termite oil—and court dues. Thirdly, there were customary gifts that his subjects made him: presents after a successful legal action, gifts made by those who sought his favour, and the ordinary gifts which a Zande was expected to bring when he made a visit to court. Most of these were in the form of perishable foodstuffs or beer, and a chief did not accumulate them, but returned them to his subjects as presents or hospitality. A chief was expected to be generous and to entertain lavishly, to assist his needy subjects with subsistence and to acquire wives, to hold feasts and dances, while any Zande who visited court expected a substantial free meal. The myths which explain Avungara leadership stress the fact that because Kurangbwa 55 had dispensed excellent food he soon had a good following. Within this framework the gifts of food did not need [Page 60] to be prescribed, nor indeed could they be when supplies were so fluctuating; as generosity was a virtue that earned respect, subjects liked to give in order to increase their personal prestige, and chiefs, for the sake of their reputations, had to be lavish. The chief who was stingy knew that his subjects would show their diminishing respect by lessening their gifts, while the commoner who gave to his chief when he could knew that he would be assisted in his turn when need arose. The chief’s reserve was a sort of relief store. 56 Nevertheless, the commoner’s economic obligations to his chief were not enforced by sanctions such as those which bound him politically and legally; thus the Zande subject who was able to shirk his duties did so, even though he recognized his theoretical obligations.Chiefs relied for essential produce on their own gardens; 57 tribute from their subjects would be restricted in amount by the limited subsistence agriculture practised by Azande, and was returned to them, plus any domestic surplus from the chief’s own gardens, either in celebrations or as recompense or dole. Of course the two supplies were not accounted for separately in that way, either by chief or subject. The chief saw that his people gave their tribute and the people saw that their chief was generous."																															25	No	"Travellers, Junker 58 particularly, have commented on the simple mode of life, in food, dress, and ceremony, followed by the chiefs of the “early period,” in contrast with the splendour of the later Mangbetu and Avungara potentates, who had for some time been dealing with the Arab traders. This suggests that while the presence of the traders disturbed Avungara authority as a whole, it did, nevertheless, enable certain chiefs to extend their domains and acquire a firmer military and economic control over their subjects. Prisoners of war and all ivory were recognized by custom as due to the chief; and this custom was reinforced by the traders, who dealt exclusively with the chiefs and not with their subjects. The monopoly of this trade immensely increased the wealth of certain chiefs, and the redistribution of the presents which they obtained from the traders gave them a material hold over their subjects by creating new bonds of obligation. Certain chiefs accumulated great treasures. Munza’s wardrobe alone, for instance, occupied “a whole series of huts,” 59 one of which was entirely full of rare feathers. Certain chiefs also obtained enough rifles and ammunition from the traders to equip a strong band of their own warriors. This increased military strength was used by those chiefs who collected sufficient to arm a strong band, to subdue dissentients within their own chiefdoms, to attack their neighbours, and to repel the traders themselves. The best known example of a chief of this type was Mofio, who armed a band 300 strong and then held his own against the slavers. 60 But such examples are rare and the traders only temporarily influenced small areas of Zandeland."																															26	No	"For a chief to aspire to any degree of magnificence it was necessary for him not only to have a large group of working wives, and a strongly disciplined palanga, but also to be politically secure in his chiefdom. According to Lagae a chief had certain privileges which enabled him to marry a large number of wives, thus contracting personal ties with their families, and at the same time to accumulate a store of wealth which he could use to attach others to himself. When a chief took a wife among his subjects he was not obliged to pay the customary bridewealth though he might make a token payment of two or three knives. On the death of a chief’s wife his subjects were expected to contribute gifts as marks of their sorrow [Page 61] and mourning and these the chief was expected to hand on to the father of the dead woman."																															27	No	"When the daughter of a chief was taken in marriage by a commoner, her husband was obliged to contribute between 40 and 60 knives, or at least double the usual bridewealth. This clearly placed the chief in a position where he was certain to acquire wives and knives though they would not normally remain as accumulated stock."																															28	No	"Lagae 62 records an indirect method by which chiefs, through their control of the administration of justice, could obtain, if not direct revenue, at any rate food-producing women. If the chief’s oracle had decided in favour of the defendant in an adultery case, and the chief had awarded the customary damages of one woman and 20 knives, the defendant would often keep the knives only, and surrender the woman to his chief.From the stock of women he acquired by methods such as the above, and from those captured in war, a chief might reward a faithful servant with a wife, thereby making his servant further obliged to him, for the chief could assume some of the attributes of a father-in-law. In such cases no bridewealth was paid and there were none of the usual ceremonies, and any daughters of the marriage were delivered up to the chief and were known as daughters of the gift ( wilimofu). 63 "																															29	No	"In the sphere of “ political ” relationships between chiefs, a king was always the father or elder brother of his subordinate chiefs, and any subordinate chief would be in the same relationship to his own subordinate “ sub-chiefs ”; thus each subordinate was bound to his superior by personal bonds of obligation, such as bound every Zande son or younger brother to his father or elder brother. These obligations, which both parties would have been brought up to recognize, included mutual assistance and the exchange of gifts, though in the absence of political organization they would not be expressed in terms of tribute or relief."																															30	No	"“ The rulers of the country do not levy regular taxes, but the chiefs are expected to appear before them from time to time, when they bring with them presents of girls, cattle, eggs, barkcloth, etc. During the time of their residence at court, the sovereign is bound to find them in food, which accounts for the great crowd of servants, and especially wives, belonging to each chief, for upon them devolves the cultivation of the fields.” 64But even these obligations 65 between Avungara were often weakened by the ambition of individual chiefs to break away and be independent; often a tribute obligation, though recognized, was not honoured because it could not be exacted by force. We suggest that, in so far as a subordinate chief was expected by his king to make presents of the kind referred to by Emin Pasha, there was a constant [Page 62] incitement to each chief to raid his neighbours and, if possible, annex fresh territories, not only in order to increase his own power, and thereby his chances of becoming independent or succeeding the king on his death, but also to extort from the defeated the presents that he in turn was expected to give. The tribute system thus encouraged and supported the Mangbetu policy of aggressive expansion. In the political and economic organization of the Zande, which was similar to that of the Mangbetu, the same forces were presumably at work. We have no idea what quantities of food-stuffs were brought to a chief by a sub-chief’s tribute-bearing party, but as everything had to be carried by porters, the amount could never have been a great deal more than would be required to entertain the party with food and drink."																															31	No	"A chief’s economic well-being seems, therefore, to have been related to the extent of his political authority over his subordinate chiefs.Few definite conclusions can be drawn about the economic relations either between chief and commoner or between chief and chief. The accounts given by our authorities nowhere present a complete picture, and indeed frequently do not tally, though the contradictions are sometimes more apparent than real. It is certain that all commoners were under an obligation to deliver to their chiefs all ivory, all prisoners of war, and a share of the spoils of the chase; to make periodic gifts of produce, to build and maintain the chief’s homestead, and to serve in his palanga or bodyguard-labour squad. These obligations were an extension of those existing between members of a homestead and its head, between homestead heads and their deputy, and between deputies and their chiefs, who were invariably close kinsmen.Thus, the Zande economic system, aided by the influence of the traders, increased the political solidarity of certain chiefdoms and kingdoms, though in others the political authority of the Avungara was weakened by the acquisitive actions of individual chiefs, the formation of independent groups within chiefdoms, and the setting up of permanent zeribas by traders. In addition the traders were prepared to ally themselves with one chief against another and to intervene in succession wars, thus intruding an extraneous force into the social and political struggle."																															32	No	"Before European occupation warfare occupied a great part of the male Zande’s time, and the Azande were noted and redoubtable warriors. The comparative efficiency of their military organization is demonstrated by the extent of their conquests. Although a chief depended for a part of his labour upon his palanga this was primarily a military organization.The palanga or aparanga, as it is called in the Sudan, 66 was the nucleus of a chief’s forces. The members lived at court in special huts at the entrance to the chief’s enclosure. It consisted of a selection of the young unmarried warriors of the chiefdom; Seligman mentions 20 years as the recruiting age. There seem to have been two types of young men who were consistently recruited: those whose families for some reason were poor, and who sought advancement at court, where the chief’s favour would compensate for their social shortcomings; it was probably men of this class who received wives without payment of bridewealth, as mentioned by Lagae. 67 The second type consisted of boys whom the chiefs often received as pages and educated. Apalanga were perforce unmarried, not apparently by regulation but because of their restricted opportunities.The palanga was under the direct orders of the chief, and was ready at all times both for raiding and as a garrison to protect the chief from surprise attacks, a chief usually siting his settlement so that his personal huts could only be approached through those of his palanga. They were also ready for instant action should a [Page 63] herd of elephants enter the neighbourhood, an event which was recognized as being of “ national importance,” because of the hundredweights of ivory and tons of meat that there was a chance of securing. 68 The chief’s control of the palanga was in this respect valuable to him economically, because he was able to trade the ivory and feast his people. The only information about the size of a palanga is given by Schweinfurth, who estimated Chief Nganye’s bodyguard as between 20 and 30; Nganye being a chief who maintained his court in medium luxury.The control of such a body of permanent warriors must have reinforced a chief’s authority and, although they may at times have been an embarrassment, a chief who had ability could direct the organization to strengthen his own personal power. A confidential duty of the chief’s warriors was to keep under observation the network of connecting paths around the chief’s court, especially if the chief was suspicious of the loyalty of any of his followers. 69	"																															33	No	"The organization for defence was simple: the chief summoned his warriors by sounding the war drum, and they came immediately. To start a war, however, was a more complicated procedure. The chief, according to Seligman, “ organized the war party, decided the number of fighting men, the order of battle, the use of magic, the disposal of prisoners, etc.” 73 Lagae’s account 74 is fuller and confirms that the chief was prime mover, though he could not act without his people. Indeed, surrounded as he was by his young warriors, it was often in fact the chief who was urged into organizing a raid to satisfy his people. He was the only person able to declare war or make peace, and he could initiate proceedings by consulting his oracle to see if the time was propitious for war. If the oracle 75 gave a favourable answer the chief would summon his deputies, outline to them his plans, and recount the decision of the oracle. He would not ask them directly if they favoured the war, but by the enthusiasm of their response would decide whether or not to proceed with his plans. If the chief’s people clamoured for war he sent a deputation bearing a broken spear, which ensured safe conduct, to the enemy chief and laid his demands before him. Wars were generally the culmination of a long period of hostility and jealousy between chiefs. Indeed there was an almost perpetual state of war between most neighbouring chiefdoms, as for instance between Gbudwe and Wando, which sometimes remained latent and sometimes broke out into open fighting."																															34	No	"Two or more chiefs would often join together in temporary alliance in order to raid a third; sometimes this bond was reinforced by the two chiefs contracting bloodbrotherhood. If a chief wished another to join him in such a raiding alliance, he sent a bundle of spears by his messenger as a token. 76 War was also declared by [Page 64] displaying symbolical tokens. 77 Most Zande wars were waged over succession disputes, or as part of a constant battle for prestige between two powerful independent chiefs; but chiefs situated on the Zande marches constantly endeavoured to increase the number of their subjects, and hence their prestige, by conquering and absorbing their non-Zande neighbours. Larken states that a chief would first dispatch spies ( a-bomai) to settle in the enemy country so as to act as guides to his troops when he later attacked. When the war drums sounded the warriors collected and were dispatched under the command of a distinguished soldier."																															35	No	"Battles did not usually last long, although a state of war might last for months or even years. Azande usually attacked shortly after dawn, and night fighting was rare. All the authorities have noted that the chief rarely accompanied his troops into battle but remained behind with his women and a picked guard, ready to slip into the forest or swamps if the enemy were victorious. There were exceptions to this rule, however, and the most conspicuously successful chiefs did accompany their troops. All booty and prisoners were the chief’s property, though he was expected to share his good fortune with his people. If a chief was excessively avaricious and did not distribute the booty, his people might refuse to follow him to war."																															36	No	"Formerly the news of the death gradually spread through the chiefdom and the sons of the chief then prepared for the succession struggle which usually followed. All the kin of the chief, indeed the whole of the kingdom, assumed mourning and [Page 79] assembled about the court. There are no obligations on his kin to avenge the death of a chief, which is generally attributed to sorcery or cats. 6868 Evans-Pritchard, 24, 1937, p. 33. Lagae (6, 1926, p. 222) says that the oracle is consulted and the witch privily destroyed. See below, p. 84.Nowadays the successor to a chiefdom retires into the ngbwadimo of his father without fear of usurpation, and consults the oracles as to the time when he shall present himself to his new subjects. On the chosen day there is general rejoicing and a great feast and distribution of gifts. The new chief then consults the oracles as to whether he should build another homestead for himself; if he does so, the homestead of the late chief is left to revert to bush, but is not burned."																															37	No	"Though the most knowledgeable witch-doctors tend to become leaders, there is no institutionalized organization or leadership among them. Those witch-doctors who live near together may form a corporation; and there is always a gbia (leader) of the group, who is distinguished from the others by his personality, age, and knowledge of medicines. But important as a witch-doctor is in his ritual capacity as a fighter of witchcraft, and powerful as he may become as a result of the economic rewards of his profession, people only treat him as a witch-doctor when he is practising as one, and he enjoys no added status or respect in other spheres of social life."																															38	No	"“Unlike all other tribes in the district, the Azande neither buy nor sell their wives, although they are polygamists in the highest degree, there being practically no limit to the number of women who may be owned as wives by the chief."																															39	No	"“The chiefs of this tribe have a much greater power than that usually invested by the Central African natives in their chiefs, who oftener than not are chiefs only in name, and bear an empty title that carries with it very few rights. The Azande chief is an important functionary both in time of peace and in the conduct of warfare. His rule is absolute almost to despotism; life and death are in his hands, nor does he neglect the exercise of these prerogatives.”"																															40	No	"“One of their methods of trial is the ordeal by poison. The accused, being brought before the chief, is ordered to drink a cup of some virulent poison, the ingredients of which are jealously kept secret. He receives the cup and takes the draught. He stands still for a moment, all around watching eagerly what the effect on him will be. Not a word is spoken, absolute silence reigning over the proceedings. His hands begin to quiver--not from fear, but by reason of the action of the poison, which has a contracting effect upon the muscles. Gradually his sinews tighten; he becomes quite rigid, falling dead without a sound. He is considered innocent if the drug fail in its effect, of if he vomit it, but it has nearly always the same fatal result.The termination of the ordeal is almost a foregone conclusion in every case, for it may well be assumed that a chief will not impose the ordeal by poison unless he is anxious to get rid of the person suspected"																															41	No	"“The king [JMA: i.e. Kanna, a southern Zande chief] heard complaints in public, and pronounced sentence on the spot, such being the traditional custom of the Sandeh. The execution of the sentence was also immediate, and if death by strangulation was to be the fate of the offender, the corpse was left to be devoured by wild animals and rapacious birds, or was either eaten or buried according to the judgment. Sometimes, as a sign of the Sovereign’s clemency, the decree ordered one half of the body to be interred, the other part to be eaten or left for the beasts."																															42	No	“It is in the use of beverages that the black shows his tendency to debauchery. To drink deeply is considered a sign of strength and bravery. A chief must know how to drink; he must get drunk often and thoroughly. This habit is one of the causes of frequent riots and hatred between individuals and families of the same tribe.”																															43	No	"Azande have many muskets, which are now imported only as gifts from the government to Azande chiefs. Each chief receives one or two muskets as his bonus per ton of india-rubber delivered by his subjects. Beautifully worked leather cartridge-belts worn by warriors are even more common than fire-arms. These were already in wide circulation at the time of De La Kéthulle De Ryhove’s journey; he mentions the fact that they were called “kaffa”."																															44	No	"The single Azande clans seem to have very varied origins, and to stem mainly from the aboriginal population. For instance, the Akowe were unquestionably once Momwu, and were only accepted by the Azande clan later on. I was assured that the Abanga stem from the Abarambo; and although the Apania call themselves Azande, it is alleged that they still generally speak Abarambo among themselves. On the whole, this gives us a picture of the secondary homogenetic process in this ethnic area that had been so cut up by the Azande migrations. The separate clans do not become completely disorganized when they enter their new social structure. The chief’s power is the greatest integrating factor. It not only minimizes contrasts, but also the differences between the clans, and has created the present Azande people out of all the heterogeneous elements."																															45	No	"The Azande clan-system is headed by the strong development of a system of chiefs. The chief stands so high above the level of the subjugated clans, that members of these amount to little more than slaves. He has full rights over clan-members, as well as over their property, despite the fact that he is continually faced with their resistance, for a clan is not disorganized, but only subjugated. The chief is war-lord, as well as the supreme judge. But he is not a law-giver, since everything has to be dealt with according to custom. Besides ivory and his part of the spoils of the hunt, the taxes which an Azande chief collects from his subjects are minimal; they are greatly disproportionate to his power, and can really be regarded as gifts. Because of this, his many wives have to cultivate extensive fields in order to provide for the house-hold. His subjects refuse to be saddled with this burden."																															46	No	"But, despite this, we cannot ignore the existence of certain social tensions. The chiefs, who are always anxious to maintain their position, appear to show some distrust of men of importance (Grössen) and therefore tend to lean on the lower class population for support against them. The custom, noted by Hutereau, which permits an Avungura to lend any slave, who has twice fled to him for protection, to another man indicates this; and this power makes the chief the protector of the weak."																															47	No	"Casati points out that the severity with which misdemeanors and crimes are punished depends on the individual chiefs; he contrasts bloodthirsty Bakangoi with farsighted Kana. But even this good-natured chief has anyone who attempts to leave his territory killed by ax-blows. Bakangoi had condemned persons killed by strangulation. The victim was hanged to a tree, and his feet were pulled until he died."																															48	No	"Azande society does not recognize money as a means for exercising power over the individual. Among the Azande, ones needs cannot be satisfied by money. In order for an Azande man to satisfy his relatively simple needs, he must have wives. His wife provides him with a household, she [55] cultivates his fields and gardens, bears him children, supplies all his needs. She makes the Azande independent. The chief, in order to have authority, must therefore have an influential say in all matters concerning the purchase of women. The more conclusive his word is, the greater his power."																															49	No	"In spite of the fact that the power of the chief is very great, he still has to consider the clans that are subject to him. These clans often pursue interests that differ from those of the chief, and may even be partially opposed to his; this limits his power to a certain, but not too great an extent. It shifts the limits of his power in one direction or another, depending on the personality of the chief. Therefore, the specific pattern of relationship obtaining between a chief and his clan is limited, and cannot be defined in general terms, as certain observers have maintained.A clan has to have solidarity and resistance in order to protect its interests against the outside world. Small clans cannot assert themselves as strongly as large clans, nor protect the interests of their members as effectively. Therefore, it is everyone’s duty to have as many children as possible, which explains the respect given to mothers. Since the primary requirement for a man is a wife, the clan attaches particular importance to the mother. The sterile wife is a possession that does not produce the assets expected of her, hence she is disdained.The clan has to procure wives for its members in order to make sure of offspring. This brings it into conflict with its chief, who is trying to exercise his power and discipline by means of the possession of women in the higher social group that is made up of many clans. So an equilibrium has to be established between the centrifugal efforts of the clan, and the centripetal goals of the chief. The extent of a chief’s power depends on how many wives a chief can assemble in his harem and be free to bestow on his subjects."																															50	No	"If a chief is powerful, he does not limit his descendants to the women he has loaned, whose eldest daughter, according to law, is supposed to return to his harem. But if he is weak, then clans can exchange and purchase a larger number of women. It is not unusual for chiefs to buy wives for their subjects.If the clans are powerful, they have little consideration for the chief. This is also shown by the fact that women of subjugated clans enjoy far greater freedom before marriage than the Avungura women, although they too set a high value on virginity. The main point is that girls can have intercourse with their suitors before the payment is effected. Intercourse takes place whenever there is an opportunity for it, but always openly and with the one man only. The clan’s interests are not harmed by this."																															51	No	"Certainly in the Sudan their opposition was always sporadic, uncertain, and local. Sometimes a chief would attempt to punish members of a Society when he thought they had committed some crime or had flouted his authority, while at other times he would [Page 108-109b] permit them to perform their ceremonies in peace, or would even summon the head of a lodge to give him magic. In the same way to-day some chiefs are opposed to the Society in a half-hearted way, the stimulus of their opposition being due less to their own opinions than to knowledge of those of the European. Other chiefs are members and supporters of Mani. It would, in fact, be possible for the chiefs to stamp out all these secret societies with the power of the [109] Government behind them were they so disposed, but those who are not themselves already members, waver between doubt about the morality of Mani magic and the political results of the lodges on the one hand and a desire to partake in the protection which its magic affords on the other hand.”"																															52	No	"Paramount chiefs consider it as beneath their dignity to take part in a public dance, but there will often be a chief’s son present, and even when he is no more than a boy his decision in any dispute or quarrel will be final. But leadership of the chiefs is extraneous to the structure of the dance, which has its own specific leadership. Song-leaders [454] are called baiango. "																															53	No	"The dance, like all joint activities, necessarily generates leadership, the function of which is to organize the activity. The problem of the allotment of roles in the dance is solved by the introduction of status. In the event of quarrels it is the song-leader who arbitrates. When food or beer is provided it is given to him for distribution. Whilst it must not be thought that the song-leader is invested with great power or that his rank is highly developed, he has considerable prestige and reputation and a definite social role to perform in this activity.”"																															54	No	"“The leader’s prestige is of course conditioned by his ability in composing and singing songs, but his ability in the eyes of the Azande is due to the possession of the right magic. No man who had not the correct magic could be a good author and singer of songs. In return for small presents, sometimes as much as a spear-head, the [455] song-leader will give magic to his followers. The eating of the magic acts in two ways. Firstly, it gives a man confidence to enable him to compose and to sing his songs and attract suali or followers. Secondly, it gives him a diploma, a right to take the most prominent place in a dance. One man, in my service, used sometimes to have quarrels when we were travelling in a strange district, since he considered himself a good soloist and tried to monopolize this role. People used to ask him from whom he had got his magic and the fact that he was able to tell them that he had it from a famous song-leader to some extent disarmed criticism."																															55	No	"Another Zande said: « A prince used to build his home at the side of some stream, with just his own people around him. The deputies built their homes far away from the prince’s, along other streams. However, the ordinary Azande lived all over the place. When something important happened at court as, for example, the prince wishes to go to war, then the deputies went to court; and when their men arrived they collected where their deputy was. When they came they asked where their leader was. They did not join the men of another leader. Everything had to be in order. The deputies had no boundaries, their following was all over the place. Their men came together only in time of war, together with their leaders. » I have to leave this question with those statements, adding to them only that besides one main deputy in each district there were also lesser ones who acted as his representatives in the district, in the military company, and at court.These deputies were carefully selected by the governor of a province among well tested men who had served for many years at court. Being a prominent public figure and a well-known person at court was always, as I have said earlier, a hazard, but at least in one respect a deputy enjoyed security which a commoner governor of a province lacked. A king who wished to give a province to one of his sons was tempted to find some excuse to remove a commoner governor from office and to hand his province over to his own son or to let his son usurp the governor’s authority bit by bit, but it would not have been to his advantage to let one of his sons or some other noble gain authority within his own province at the expense of a deputy, for then he might lose labour and tribute, for the Azande would tend to give at any rate part of their labour and tribute to the noble, even though he acknowledged the prince’s suzerainty. It is true that a deputy might be removed, but only to be replaced by another commoner representative of the prince. Their master only deprived them of their office for the most serious reasons. « In the past, » said a Zande, « a prince never took the authority of ligbu away from a man for a small matter, only for a big reason, such as witchcraft, disloyalty, theft of tribute, and adultery with the wives of his subjects. It was on account of such matters that a prince used to take ligbu from a man and put another in his place. Gangura drove from ligbu one [Page p.690] of his elders, whose name was Bandapai, of the Abanzuma clan. Bandapai had congress with the wife of his own son, because she was pleasing to him. Bandapai also killed with witchcraft another of Gangura’s ligbu men. On account of these two things. Gangura drove him away. Mabu, one of Gangura’s aligbu, bewitched Gangura’s eyes. His eyes closed up altogether so that he could not see with them. The poison oracle said that it was Mabu who had bewitched him. Gangura therefore removed him from the position of ligbu, » I was told that a man would have been removed from this position if he displayed cowardice in war or hunting."																															56	No	"The deputies, as has been noted, were responsible in their capacity of leaders of senior companies (baliabakumbavura) for some work in the cultivations and for leading their company in war. Other duties were to collect tribute; to visit court frequently to attend their master, acquaint him with the affairs of their districts, and advise him on matters of public interest; to settle disputes which did not require royal judgment; and to conduct oracle-tests when any question arising at court requiring them had [Page p.691] to be settled.What concerns us here is the collection of tribute. All elephant tusks and leopard skins belonged to the ruler. Also, commoners were expected to give him a portion of animals killed in hunting (only the bushbuck was never presented at court, on account of its timidity) and a portion of their termite harvest, either raw termites or their oil, though no definite amounts of either were required of them. A man who was used to court life and was known to the prince would bring gifts of these and other kinds to court and present them to the prince in person. Such gifts were intended for his personal consumption. Persons not used to court life would make their contributions to a deputy, and all married men made contributions to him in some measure so that the tribute could be paid in the name of the whole company of that district. Since contributions were made by everyone, whether a member of the company or not, the tribute was in fact a levy on the whole district, but it appears to have been presented in the name of the company and to whichever queen the company was attached to. Men who lived at some distance from the deputy’s home collected their tribute in the home of the most senior of them, and he sent it to the deputy to be added to the joint contribution of the whole district. Even if a man had already made private [Page 214] gifts of produce to the prince it was still necessary for him to pay tribute to him through a deputy, for otherwise when he was eating at court he might be accused of eating the prince’s food without having contributed to it. The only (married) men in a district who did not pay tribute through a deputy in charge of that district were those who paid it to the leader of their company in a different district."																															57	No	"« All these things they give to a prince, he does not keep them from the people. If, for example, it is oil, the prince has bowls of porridge cooked, and the relish to go with the porridge will be oil. Those things the subjects of a prince present to him, he must not eat a single one of them, and his chief wife must not eat a single one of them, for if they eat of them the people of his province will all depart and attach themselves to a different prince. It is for this reason that a prince leaves alone that thing his subjects give him. Princes abstain from this food, for that is their custom which long ago originated with their ancestors. Those who are yet growing up learn it from their fellows. However, when an elder stalks a prince with some little gift like meat or some other such thing, the prince eats this thing; but if it is tribute, the prince will not eat it in any circumstances. Such is the custom of paying tribute in provisions to princes. The subjects of all princes pay them tribute. »"																															58	No	"The Zande empire was split into a number of kingdoms founded by adventurous princes who preferred to carve out domains for themselves rather than to remain in feudal subjection to father or brother. A kingdom was divided into provinces administered by a king’s younger brothers and sons and a few wealthy commoners appointed by him. These provincial governors in their turn exercised authority through local deputies directly responsible to them for the conduct of their districts. The territorial correlative to this political system was a king’s court from which broad paths struck out, starlike, to the minor courts of his princely and commoner governors where lesser paths radiated to hamlets at which resided important deputies. The whole country-side was dotted with homesteads, abodes of single families, often widely separated from each other by cultivations and stretches of forest. If we had taken a cross-section of a Zande district we would have found that a homestead comprised a man and his wife, or wives, and children, while his nearest neighbours were generally related to him by bonds of kinship or marriage. A chief’s deputy chose a site near some stream and along both banks were stretched out the homes of his relatives and those whom he patronized."																															59	No	"Witches usually combine in their destructive activities and subsequent ghoulish feasts. They assist each other in their crimes and arrange their nefarious schemes in concert. They possess a special kind of ointment, which, rubbed into their skins, renders them invisible on nocturnal expeditions, a statement which suggests that witches are sometimes thought to move in [Page 39] the body to attack their enemies. They also possess small drums which are beaten to summon them to congress where their discussions are presided over by old and experienced members of the brotherhood, for there are status and leadership among witches. Experience must be obtained under tuition of elder witches before a man is qualified to kill his neighbours. Growth in experience goes hand in hand with growth of witchcraft-substance. It is also said that a witch may not kill a man entirely on his own initiative but must present his proposals to a meeting of his fellows presided over by a witch-leader. The question is thrashed out among them."																															60	No	"If he is short tempered he may make a scene when a fowl’s wing is placed before him. He may tell the messenger to take it away and may curse the people who sent it, and say that they are simply trying to humiliate him out of malice. Such scenes are rare, but I have either witnessed or had good knowledge of several, and men have been known to injure a messenger. A man who behaves in this manner is acting contrary to custom and is insulting the chief’s deputy who ordered the wing to be laid before him. He will be laughed at as a provincial who is ignorant of the manners of polite society, and may gain the reputation of a hardened witch who admits his witchcraft by [Page 123] the anger he displays when it is found out. What he ought to do is to blow out water and say: ‘If I possess witchcraft in my belly I am unaware of it; may it cool. It is thus that I blow out water.’"																															61	No	"Joint local functioning tends in the same manner to produce leadership, though not permanent or institutional leadership. What I have already written about the conduct of a seance is sufficient to show that some degree, in point of fact quite a high degree, of co-ordination of behaviour is essential. The spacial arrangements of the dancing place and the mode of dancing by themselves necessitate some kind of organization and leadership. But the full functions of leadership will be clearer when I have described also the esoteric side of a witch-doctor’s life."																															62	No	"Azande have an unusually well-developed political sense, and any joint activity in which they engage takes on the pattern of their political structure. There is always a gbia of any undertaking. This word properly means ‘noble’ but may also be used simply as a title of respect to a commoner, and in this context refers to the leader in an activity. When a member of the aristocracy enters into an activity he is almost invariably the gbia, or stands largely outside its organization. When the undertaking is manned by commoners one of them will act as the gbia, on the pattern of the noble-commoner relationship, though without its full content. I have explained earlier that nobles do not become witch-doctors, so that it is always a commoner who acts as leader on the ground of age, experience, personality, achievement, and knowledge of magic. Wealth and social position also qualify a man to some extent to play a leading role, even when his experience and knowledge [Page 204] of magic are smaller than those possessed by other members of the corporation. Thus, in our settlement, when Bage performed at seances he took a leading part, since he carried his political status with him into a sphere of life where he was not acting as a political agent. But the real leader was Badobo. Badobo, a man of middle age, had possessed witch-doctors’ magic for a longer time than any one else in our neighbourhood. His father had been a witch-doctor before him and had initiated him into the craft as a boy. He was tactful, but did not show any of the striking characters which usually designate a leader, and his central position among the local practitioners was derived mainly from his personal relations with each individual, since he had taught most of them their knowledge of medicines and had sponsored them at initiation. There were two or three other practitioners who were thought to equal Badobo in professional skill, but they lacked the same personal following derived from dependence of pupil on teacher."																															63	No	"Since witch-doctors who act together professionally all live in the same neighbourhood and have the same range of social contacts, they are bound together by a large number of general social bonds outside their professional ties. Thus all are members of the same political groups. Some are related by blood, others by marriage, others by blood-brotherhood, others by membership of the same secret society, and so on. Of chief importance is their common membership of the same local group, where spacial density necessitates daily contacts and a common range of experience. Both the cohesion and the leadership which we find among witch-doctors of any locality depend largely on general social conditions which have no specific relationship to their corporation."																															64	No	"Bögwözu had lately arrived in our neighbourhood and had shown himself an able organizer and a resourceful schemer. He at once dominated the local practitioners and browbeat them into accepting his leadership by his far-reaching claims and his imposing figure and personality. He told every one that his magic was not the old Zande magic of witch-doctors, böndöku, but more powerful magic which he had learned among the Baka people from a man whose name, Bögwözu, he had taken for his professional cognomen. He said that this man had sent him to examine into the state of witch-doctors of our area and find out whether they really possessed mbiro (medicines) and mangu (‘witchcraft’) in their stomachs and, if not, to supply them. He outraged Badobo and Alenvo by telling them and their colleagues that he had looked in vain into their bodies and had found neither medicines nor ‘witchcraft’ there. He proceeded, for about a month, to reorganize their fraternity. He gave them new professional names and cooked medicines for them to eat, at the same time warning them that unless they paid him fees for his trouble he would throw them out of the fraternity and would, on his return home, make magic so that the medicines which he had given them to eat would be cast out of their bodies. He even told Badobo that if he had not had a feeling of goodwill towards him he would have attacked and killed him with his [Page 220] medicine yaguma. He would have stirred his medicated water with the same result. He imposed restrictions on entrance into the corporation, telling the local specialists how stupid they had been to initiate so many persons on such inadequate fees. He tightened up their procedure and imposed more rigorous taboos."																															65	No	"Magic may be an alternative to empirical means of attaining an end, but it is not so satisfactory a method. It was better in the old days, when a witch either paid compensation or was slain with a spear, than it is to-day when one must make magic to kill him. Magic may give a greater measure of success to an undertaking than would have been obtained without its use. Thus, as was noted earlier, natural conditions and human knowledge of them, and skill in exploiting them, ensure a harvest of termites. The use of a magical technique is secondary to the use of an empirical technique. It cannot normally replace it. It is an aid rather than a substitute. Likewise, medicines to attract followers doubtless make a prince more popular than he would otherwise have been, but a prince who used such medicines alone and did not provide food for his subjects would soon find his court deserted‘But the first of all medicines for attracting followers is food, which stands alone as a medicine of this kind. To give food to his subjects is the best medicine for a prince to use to attract followers. Men sit in court and the prince sends a messenger to find out what [Page 468] men are at court. The messenger tells the prince the name of every person in court and the prince gives them pots and bowls of food and makes his elders gifts of spears.‘For all Azande say that medicines to attract followers are porridge, spears, gifts of women, and being pleasant to all men. Azande go to live as subjects of a prince who does these things.‘Now the medicines which are cooked for a prince are zerengbondo, ngbimibagade, ranga, and many others. They collect these medicines and cook them with oil and ranga kporo. But the real medicines to attract men are gifts of food and women.’"																															66	No	"A lodge-leader receives wealth by selling knowledge of his medicines to others in the manner described. He also gets fees from laymen who wish to become members of the association, though he is expected to share these with their sponsors and with his lodge officials. He is made small presents by junior members of the association when they wish to stir and address the medicines about their affairs, for this is a privilege that must be paid for. Members who wish to enter a higher grade buy their seniority from the lodge-leader who, in return, shows them new medicines. He has also a large rubbing-board oracle called yanda which he uses, on receipt of a small present, on behalf of members who have reached the highest grade in the association.A leader has very little authority. His position is due solely to his knowledge of magic and is maintained by fear of his medicines, by the rules of the association, and by the Zande’s invariable devotion to discipline and authority in social life on the pattern of his political institutions. Organizing ability, character, and prestige in the locality also count for something. Public opinion in the lodge insists on decorum and obedience to authority in matters pertaining to the association.Besides the leader, each lodge has a few minor officials: the kenge, the uze, and the furushi. The kenge, so called after the thin stakes on which the medicine-pot rests, is next senior to the leader, and, as he often knows the medicines, he is sent into the bush by the leader to gather them. It is his duty to erect the thin stakes, to place the medicines in a pot on the fire, and to cook them. I shall speak of him as the cook. The uze is so called after the stick with which the medicines are stirred in the pot, and he alone may eat them on the end of the stick. It [Page 519] is his duty to assist in stirring the medicines, to hand them round to other members in the lodge, and to see that every one observes the rules and pays attention to the proceedings. I shall speak of him as the stirrer. There is also sometimes an official called furushi, from the Arabic word for policeman. He is told to guard the lodge from interruption and spying, and to assist the stirrer in maintaining order. I shall speak of him as the sentry. None of these officials is important. The functions of each are not rigidly restricted to the holder, and in his absence any other person can perform them. The offices are no more than slightly privileged positions in the lodge held by senior members. Members of the association are usually called Aboro Mani, ‘People of Mani’, to distinguish them from fio, laymen. They eat the medicines off the tips of their little fingers. You can discover whether a man is a member of the association by an exchange of secret formulae. Members also have their special greetings, but it is rare for these to be used outside the lodge."																															67	No	"Men fought in military companies in campaigns and when making a raid. In putting up a hasty defense against sudden attack it was not possible to fight in company formation since there was not time to muster the companies. As these companies played an important rôle in the economy of a prince’s court and also in the administration of his province I shall discuss them in greater detail elsewhere. Here it need only be said that each king and each governor of a province of a kingdom had a number of companies, divided into two classes: the aparanga, companies of youths, normally unmarried, and the abakumba, companies of married men. King Gbudwe seems to have had about twenty companies altogether. His governors probably had some five or six each, though his eldest sons, Basongoda and Mange, may have had more than that. I found it very difficult to ascertain the number of men comprising a company. It seems to have varied greatly but not to have been less than 20 or more than 100, except for Gbudwe’s Abaigo company, who may have been 200 to 300 strong. The average number seems to have been between 50 to 60 men. Each had its leader, deputy leader, and order of rank or seniority [Page 241] determined by length of service. Each of the companies of youths also had a hut at court where some of their members would generally be in residence. However, the question of how many men a company comprised is not so important as it might seem to be, because when a kingdom or province was mobilized for war all able-bodied men who belonged to no company, the aboro lingara, the people who did not frequent the court, were drafted into one or other company or attached themselves to it for the duration of the fighting. Sometimes married men accompanied companies of youths and youths accompanied their fathers in companies of married men. Members of the nobility also accompanied the force, their pages bearing their shields. Only women, children, the sick, the aged, and those whom the poison oracle had warned not to take part, were left at home; and it was the duty of the men among them to prevent panic among the women in the event of defeat and the enemy breaking through and to guide the women and children to the refuge of swamps or dense streamside woods. Anyone who failed to report for duty was fined at least ten spears; and each man was expected to bring his own spears and shield. Only those who were members of companies had also the kpinga, the throwing knife, as it was mara ngbanga, court-metal, that is, something which a king or governor distributed to men to fight his battles with. The companies may, therefore, in this respect be regarded as being like a modern army whose regiments are expanded in time of war to receive the entire male population of a country between certain ages. This meant — and here again we cannot be very precise — that a large kingdom, like that of Gbudwe in the Sudan, could probably muster some 20,000 warriors, and one of its provinces between 200 or 300 and 2,000 or 3,000, according to its size."																															68	No	"The prince sent some, if not all, of the captured women to his father the king. He had the captured weapons tied in bundles ( vodivodi baso). Some of these he sent with women to the king, the rest he retained for distribution to his warriors on some future occasion. A prince gives spears and throwing-knives to his followers to fight his wars with them, and what weapons they take from the enemy belong to him because the battle was fought with his spears and knives. Azande emphasize that this is so."																															69	No	"The king’s oracle determined the movements of the entire army, and he was commander-in-chief in the field. The army he directed was composed of the force of his own province and the forces of the other ˙provinces of his realm, each of these forces operating as a unit and under command of the provincial governor from whose province they came; and each of these battalions, if we may so call them, was made up of companies of older and younger warriors, each company having a commander and being composed, as I have earlier explained, of a nucleus of “regulars” to which were attached for military operations men who in ordinary circumstances belonged to no company. The king drew up the order of battle and told his governors what positions they were to take up and in what order they were to attack. Each governor then decided for himself, within the framework of the king’s order of battle, the dispositions and tactics of the companies constituting his own force and instructed his commanders accordingly. The governors accompanied their warriors, though usually slightly in the rear of them, and the king’s own force took up a supporting position. This was the procedure in Gbudwe’s army, and I believe that it was the same in the armies of other Zande kings. "																															70	No	"On one point these figures speak for themselves: patrilineal ties beyond the family relationships of brothers and sons play little part in determining who lives where. What counts for more are maternal links, affinity, blood-brotherhood, personal friendship, a headman’s reputation for generosity and good sense, and so forth. In Zandeland local groupings are not, except in the case of a few close neighbours, associated with clans or sections of clans, nor are they spoken about by any kinship reference. They are political and administrative units. What gives the group unity and distinctness is the common allegiance of its members to a king or prince through his representative in their community appointed by him to look after his affairs in that neighbourhood. It is only in this political sense that one can properly speak of local groups at all, for they are not otherwise distinct groups. The fact that in some cases the headman’s clan is well represented in a community might suggest that his clansmen have settled near him on account of common clanship, but it may be chance, for it can equally bear the interpretation that because the clan is numerically prominent in the area the likelihood of a headman being appointed from it is greater."																															71	No	"When Gbudwe told his son Faki to get out of his court and go and live elsewhere, as is the custom of royalty, he settled in this area and was left there to gather followers around him on his own account. At that time his brothers Gangura and Bima were in the same area, each with a small following."																															72	No	"The district of the commoner governor Pupuakondo formed part of Gbudwe’s personal domain, which appears to have stretched unevenly to the river Kisi and in places to the east of that river. Nevertheless at an earlier period he had planted governors there, for I was told that it was once ruled by Gbaro son of Likara, who had been a leader of one of Gbudwe’s military companies. He angered Gbudwe in some way and fled to the kingdom of Wando. Gbudwe pardoned him on his return and reinstated him as company leader but not as provincial governor. He was later executed during the Birisi campaign against Renzi son of Wando. Yakpati (also, I believe, called Mosanabamo) son of Gbudwe seems to have taken his place in the governorship but was later driven from it by, according to various versions, Gbudwe himself, Rikita, or the British. As far as I could gather, Pupuakondo was not given charge of the area by Gbudwe, though he was an important deputy and head of a military company in it, but by Ukwe, Gbudwe’s grandson, who for a while obtained control of Gbudwe’s territory shortly after his death, and its occupation by the British, whose confidence he had won. They are said to have been influenced in Pupuakondo’s favour by his kinsman Yango, Mange’s most powerful commoner governor, who also seems to have co-operated with the British on their arrival in his master’s country."																															73	No	"Some complications arose from Gbudwe being in Egyptian Government captivity from 1882 to 1884. During his absence his son Mboli, who had been given the eastern part of his province by Bafuka, was expelled by the donor, who placed his own eldest son Kipa in charge of it....Gbudwe gave his country to Ngoliyo. He was to prove an unsuccessful ruler who ill-treated his subjects and abused their wives, and after Gbudwe’s death he lost his subjects to Gangura. Mange had also removed his brother Boli from office and replaced him by one of his own sons. Boli’s province was restored to him by Gbudwe. "																															74	No	"Others have drawn attention to the size of royal and princely families. Junker 1 says that Bakangai listed 54 of his father Kipa’s sons, not including the youngest, whose names were unknown even to Bakangai. Casati 2 says that this same Bakangai possessed more than 500 women, and he also remarks on Kipa’s numerous children, stating that his sons alone amounted to 50. Czekanowski 3 comments that the power of a chief (princeling) called Risasi was evidently limited in that he had only 7 wives and 15 living children. Hutereau 4 reports, in noting how rapidly these aristocratic families can increase, that Kipa’s son Kana had 46 sons and 33 daughters. Gamu, his fourth son, then aged about 50, had already 24 sons and 11 daughters. Liwa, Gamu’s eldest son, aged about 38, had already 6 sons and 5 daughters (there must have been an error in Hutereau’s estimates of ages, for even Zande princes do not beget children at the age of 12). Two of the wives of Liwa’s eldest son Eliwa, a youth of about 18 years of age, were pregnant at the time the record was made. Akengai, son of the Bakangai mentioned above, had in Hutereau’s time already 40 sons and about 40 daughters. Geyer 5 tells us that it was impossible to determine the number of King Tembura’s wives and that he himself did not appear to know the exact number. It was stated to be 400. His half-brother Beka, says the same authority, had 15 wives, 16 sons and 10 daughters. Mr. T. A. T. Leitch, at one time a British official in the Sudan, mentions in an unpublished report 39 sons of the same King Tembura, of whom 21 were still alive in 1953. To give a final example: I have myself listed 22 adult sons of a minor princeling, Baduagbanga, in Gbudwe’s old kingdom, and 29 adult sons of [Page 144] Gbudwe’s son Bafuka. The sons of both men were all said to be married and to have families."																															75	No	"Probably all Zande kings appointed commoners to governorates, such persons being known as abanyaki, and it would therefore be curious that early travellers do not mention the fact were it not that the matter is barely mentioned in most writings on the Azande of a later date. Piaggia, it is true, gives the names of certain fattori of Kings Tombo and Bazingbi, and some of these may have been commoner governors. 1 The names of others suggest that they were nobles. Schweinfurth 2 knew the word banyaki (he writes it as behnky and says it is pronounced as a Frenchman would pronounce bainqui), but he, and it would appear other travellers, thought that this word meant any chief of a district acting as representative of a king, whereas it is only used by Azande for commoner governors, noble governors being called simply agbia, ‘nobles’. Schweinfurth, who appears to mention the names of two of Ngangi’s commoner governors, was probably unaware that some governors were nobles and others commoners. Junker 3 says that most of the chiefs were of noble blood and that throughout his travels he heard of only one man of political importance who came from foreign stock. Nor, apart from the one exception, Kommunda in Ndoruma’s country, does he mention any other commoner governors. Yet at the time of his residence in Zandeland there were certainly some of these in Wando’s kingdom, through which he travelled, three of them being on Gbudwe’s southern frontier, Bangodiya (Agiti clan), Ndegu (Angbadimo clan), and Ngatuo (Agiti clan), the last of whom was of sufficient importance for his subjects to have defeated an army sent against them by Gbudwe in about 1886; and I consider it certain that there were others [Page 148] in the other Zande kingdoms at that time, e.g. Hutereau 1 mentions one of them in Bakangai’s country. Junker tended to travel from the court of one king or prince to that of another and he probably would not have known when he was crossing the territory of a commoner governor if he had not made particular inquiry. Even then, he might simply have been told that it was the country of such and such a king, just as he would not have been told the names of princes’ deputies in their provinces unless he asked for them. When he passed through Gbudwe’s country he could scarcely have avoided, as his route shows, the territories of commoner governors lining the west bank of the Sueh at that time as they continued to do till the end of his reign; but it must be added that he was in a hurry to reach the Nile and that Gbudwe’s kingdom had recently been devastated by troops of the Egyptian Government and was much disorganized. Other writers say much the same, e.g. Craffen and Colombo state that the ‘vassal chiefs’ are all sons, brothers, or kinsmen of the sovereign. 2 I give further evidence later 3 to show that commoners played an important part in provincial administration."																															76	No	"It should further be mentioned that the more important princely governors sometimes put areas in their provinces under control ( ma kpolo) of commoner governors of their own and directly dependent on them and not on the king. These did not have the same status as those appointed by the king but, nevertheless, their position appears to have carried more authority than that of an ordinary deputy ( ligbu or bakumba), and the area of their administration was more self-contained than his. Thus Rikita gave jurisdiction to Toi the Bongo, with whom, as the chief of a foreign people, he made blood-brotherhood, after defeating him in war, on condition that he brought his people from the east of the Iba river to the west of it and they became his subjects. "																															77	No	"This last point of de Calonne’s is of great importance. When a prince had been for some years in charge of a province the people of it came to see themselves as a distinct political community through allegiance to him, and, as the river boundaries of provinces often remained the same when they changed hands, local particularist sentiment was thereby strengthened. The people of Gangura’s province or Rikita’s province, for example, saw themselves in a broadly patriotic sense as avuru Gbudwe, [Page 151] subjects, or followers, of Gbudwe—political solidarity being expressed by reference to the person, and through the person to the territory, rather than the other way round. But they also saw themselves as a community in a narrower and more intimate sense as avuru Gangura and avuru Rikita, since their contacts were with, and their affairs were the concern of, Gangura and Rikita and not Gbudwe. Now, all such allegiances imply, even of necessity involve, opposition to similar allegiance, and it had to be on a provincial level and could not be between a provincial attachment and that to the paramount, for that would have meant disloyalty. As we might expect, therefore, there was rivalry between the people of one province and those of one or other of its neighbours, the personal jealousies and ambitions of their rulers combining with the particularist sentiments of their subjects to make a province a kind of proto-state. The struggles which ensued after the death of a king were already latent during his lifetime and sometimes, as has been noted, could in certain circumstances, perhaps chiefly due to Arab interference and intrigue, lead to war between sons even before their father’s death. However, in the case of a strong king like Gbudwe, who kept a firm hand on his sons, fighting between one prince and another was not tolerated. Nevertheless, the stage was set for the drama which would inevitably have taken place had he left it before European intervention."																															78	No	"Ndeni son of Tombo had quarrelled with his brother Ezo. He thereupon departed with his followers to the south, where he founded a domain for himself in the country of the Ababua people beyond the Uele river. He was later murdered by them, and the leadership of his people eventually passed to his son Kipa (or Tikima), who avenged his father’s death on the Ababua and then extended his domains, warring right and left [Page 152] against other Avongara kings and the Mangbetu and other foreign peoples. In 1868 the great warrior Kipa is said to have died of a snake-bite on an expedition against the Mabode. During his lifetime he had placed his elder sons in various parts of his kingdom to rule over them. At the time of his death the main lines, following de Calonne, of their distribution were: Mange (or Ngura), the favourite son, to the north-east, on the Bomokandi; Kana, the eldest son, to the south-east; Bakangai to the south-west between the Bomokandi, the Poko, and the Makondo; Kamisa to the north-west; Nganzi, Mabura, Zebo, Ngandua, Zakala (on the left bank of the Teli), and Mingemi among foreigners, mostly sections of the Abarambo. Others were in other parts: Gwa, Bangoya (on the right bank of the Poko), Hino, etc. When Kipa died, his sons watched each other with apprehensive hostility."																															79	No	"The same process was being repeated in each of the domains of Kipa’s sons at the time Junker was in the area. The administration of the extensive territory of Bakangai, who died in 1883, ‘had been entrusted to ten of his adult sons. They were assigned separate provinces, where they carried out their father’s orders by the aid of their Zandeh subjects’ 4—most of the population being foreigners. Akangai, the eldest, resided in the east, on the Poko. Umboiko (I use his spellings) governed the Abarambo tribes of the north-west on the Makongo river. Biemangi and [Page 154] Songombosso guarded the southern frontiers, while all the rest were stationed in the interior of the state. ‘However, these relations were soon modified, for the very year after my visit Bakangai died, and his death could not fail to be attended by great changes. Although Akengai succeeded his father as paramount chief, civil strife soon broke out among the brothers, as I was later informed.’ In the same manner Kana’s vassal lords ruled his domains—his brothers or uncles or sons: ‘Ten adult sons of Kanna rule as many separate districts.’ 1"																															80	No	"This chapter is written to determine the accuracy of his statement by inquiring into the ethnic provenance of such provincial governors as were commoners and of persons holding lesser office. I have in this inquiry to rely on my own information, which with regard to commoner governors is mainly restricted to the old kingdom of Gbudwe, for none of our authorities on the Azande gives any detailed or precise information about the subject, or even any information at all. One of them, Fr. Geyer, 1 goes so far as to make the statement that only an aristocrat—a member of the ruling clan of the Avongara—can become a chief, and thus he says as a rule only close relatives of a king, such as his sons and brothers, can become chiefs, a statement which I would treat with reserve even though it refers to the old kingdoms of Tembura and Ezo with which I was myself scarcely acquainted. Much of course, depends on what he means by ‘chief’ ( Häuptling). The same ambiguity appears in von Wiese’s statement, 2 speaking of the area near Tembura Post, that ‘the sultans, village chiefs, and under-chiefs are all Asandes’. We do not know what he meant by ‘village chiefs’, especially as there were no villages, nor what he meant by ‘under-chiefs’, nor, for the matter of that, precisely what he meant by ‘sultans’. Also, we do not know what he meant by ‘Asandes’, whether the Ambomu or ‘true’ or ‘original’ Azande as distinct from persons of foreign origin, or whether he included under the term persons of foreign origin who had adopted the Mbomu language and way of life, in contrast to foreigners who had retained their speech and habits. He may well have been ignorant of the difference. This is the point which I shall now discuss."																															81	No	"When we consider the lower forms of political offiee, leadership of military companies and administrative posts within the provinces, we find that it was service at court and loyalty, ability, and character which counted, regardless of descent, in the making of appointments, though, here again, it stands to reason that the further back we go the more such offices must have been restricted to Ambomu followers of the Avongara. This cannot, however, be demonstrated on account of lack of evidence. The earliest information that I possess is a very short list of deputies and leaders of companies of unmarried warriors in Bazingbi’s personal province towards the end of his reign ( c.1865). Of the eight persons listed below four belong to Mbomu clans and four to clans of foreign stocks:"																															82	No	"These appointments are left out of the present inquiry since they are not directly involved in the question at issue. The inquiry covered the whole of that part of Zandeland which lies in what was, at the time it was conducted, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan or, in Zande terms, what were once the kingdoms of Gbudwe, Ezo, and Tembura. Three hundred and fourteen headmen have been listed and they have been found to be numerically divided among the clans as shown in the table below. In my estimation of what may be regarded as Mbomu and foreign clans, eighty-seven headmen were of Mbomu stock and 227 of various foreign stocks. The Mbomu headmen were thus in 1929-30 about 28 per cent of the total, a percentage corresponding fairly well with the ratio of the Ambomu as a whole to the total population of Sudanese Zandeland. If the Akowe and Adio are included, as before, among the Ambomu, the figures would be ninety-seven Ambomu and 217 men of foreign stocks, making the Ambomu about 31 per cent:"																															83	No	"Some five youths of the company of youths of whom Ngbatuyo was the leader went after a man’s ripe maize. They began to strip this man’s maize, who, however, was Gbudwe’s father-in-law; and moreover Gbudwe’s wife was in his homestead at the time. The owner of the maize went after these youths and abused them. They continued quarrelling and Gbudwe’s mother-in-law said to Gbudwe’s wife, her daughter, that she should hasten to come out of her hut and go to the scene, thinking that when the men saw her they would be afraid on account of her being Gbudwe’s wife. She arose and went and asked them why they were stripping her family’s maize. She made them very angry and they started to beat her, and they took off all the rings on her legs and those on her arms, for she was only a young girl. But the youths did not know she was Gbudwe’s wife. They departed with these rings. When Gbudwe heard about it he said he would kill the leader of the youths, who was Ngbatuyo. Gbudwe sent a message to him to tell him to come to court. But Ngbatuyo did not go. He collected spears, some forty of them, and he gave them, together with three baskets of fowls, to Gbudwe in compensation. Gbudwe then at once relented."																															84	No	"The cultivations were hoed in the names of the various queens or chief wives of the king, and these women had food prepared by their slaves and by the king’s other wives for the companies which hoed in their names. Men went to fetch it in the evenings from the inner court. Each queen looked after ( mbu ti) her own companies, this being the only occasion on which bowls of porridge and pots of ‘meats’ were allocated by the queens to their own companies. The commander of a company of youths also sometimes had food sent from his father’s home to supplement that provided by the royal wives. He did this to attract youths into his company. The sketch facing shows the distribution of labour among the different companies."																															85	No	"In addition to providing labour in the royal cultivations Azande make their princes gifts in kind, a tribute collected by the aligbu, prince’s deputies. The aligbu were the links between the prince or king and his subjects, and they had charge of the various districts in the provinces. It appears, however, that these districts, unlike the provinces, were not territorially well defined. The authority of the ruler of a province extended between certain streams, and anyone who lived between those streams was his vuru, subject. The prince ruled ( zoga) him and he was the man of ( ra fu) the prince. People who lived outside that area were subjects of other provincial governors, and a man could not live in one province and be the man of a ruler of another province...When I was in Zandeland most of the Sudan Azande had been moved into settlements along government roads, and their attachment to a prince’s deputy was determined by the settlement they lived in, each settlement being in charge of a deputy. In the past, according to the information I was given, when men moved from one district to another they often retained their attachment to the deputy predominant in the district in which they formerly lived, though they presumably did so only if the districts were not very distant from each other. The reason for this seems to have been that the military organization crossed the territorial organization, so that a man who moved from one area to another might still wish to remain a member of his vura, ‘company’, for purposes of fighting, labouring on the royal estates, and paying tribute. The whole following of a ligbu would therefore only come together in fighting and hoeing the king’s cultivations; and some Azande have told me that, as far as their distribution is concerned, they were wunzuguwunzugu, ‘all over the place’. This may have been the case, but I believe that in all matters other than war, labour, and tribute a man recognized the authority of the deputy of his district. If this were so, we have to distinguish between the two roles of a deputy, his role as leader of a senior company and his more general role as the prince’s representative in a district. The military organization had long disappeared before I first visited the Azande, and I have to admit that I was never quite clear about how it worked in relation to territorial divisions. The information I was given on this question was not always entirely consistent and sometimes appeared to be contradictory, but this I think was due to the fact that the word ligbu can be used in a very general sense to mean also banyaki, ‘commoner governor’. I have heard Gami speak in this sense.The ligbu men made their homes without any precise order, with their kinsmen near them. Their followers made their homes anywhere, and in the neighbourhood of deputies other than their own. Only when it came to war did companies separate out, each gathering round its commander. As the men mustered each asked where his commander was located. They did not divide the country into territorial areas of influence in the case of deputies. Those who followed one deputy might make their homes near another deputy, but nevertheless they were the men of the first deputy."																															86	No	"A prince used to build his home at the side of some stream, with just his own people around him. The deputies built their homes far away from the prince’s, along other streams. However, the ordinary Azande lived all over the place. When something important happened at court as, for example, the prince wished to go to war, then the deputies went to court; and when their men arrived they collected where their deputy was. When they came they asked where their leader was. They did not join the men of another leader. Everything had to be in order. The deputies had no boundaries, their following was all over the place. Their men came together only in time of war, together with their leaders."																															88	No	"All these things they give to a prince, he does not keep them from the people. If, for example, it is oil, the prince has bowls of porridge cooked, and the relish to go with the porridge will be oil. Those things the subjects of a prince present to him, he must not eat a single one of them, and his chief wife must not eat a single one of them, for if they eat of them the people of his province will all depart and attach themselves to a different prince. It is for this reason that a prince [Page 218] leaves alone that thing his subjects give him. Princes abstain from this food, for that is their custom which long ago originated with their ancestors. Those who are yet growing up learn it from their fellows. However, when an elder stalks a prince with some little gift like meat or some other such thing, the prince eats this thing; but if it is tribute, the prince will not eat it in any circumstances. Such is the custom of paying tribute in provisions to princes. The subjects of all princes pay them tribute."																															89	No	"With the porters came the slaves. Gbudwe selected the cleverer and more handsome boys to serve him as confidential pages and to handle his oracles. The rest hoed his gardens and those of his sons and followers to whom he gave them. Of the women and girls (some of whom had babies) he kept the most beautiful in Zande eyes, those brightest of eye and clearest of skin and with full breasts, for his couch. Others he gave to his wives to serve them. Some he gave to his sons and provincial governors, and yet others to his commoner governors and his deputies and company commanders. But even more welcome than women and boys were the guns Mange sent his father. He seems to have acquired them—I am not conversant with affairs in his province—by war and trade with the Arab trading companies or the Egyptian Government forces which operated in the region bordering his province to the east. Gbudwe gave these to his followers, increasing, as he obtained them, his body of gunmen, or to his sons. From the north and east came also bundles of spears, manufactured by skilled Mundu and Bongo smelters and smiths."																															90	No	"A king who intended to attack another’s kingdom sent messengers to his governors instructing them to mobilize their companies and then to meet him at a certain place and as quickly as possible. This took some time, as some of the provinces were at a considerable distance from the royal court; and those who were most distant arrived later than those who were nearer. There was no attempt at concealment of these preparations. On the contrary, before a war was launched there would be demonstrations at the king’s court, and possibly in the courts of provincial governors also, which served to stimulate enthusiasm and hostile intention. This was known as selekpo vura, the making of long and boastful speeches threatening the rulers of neighbouring territories or foreign enemies, at Gbudwe’s court usually the Arabs. The king himself, such of his sons or [Page 253] commoner governors who were at court, and Gbudwe’s elder courtiers and leaders of companies made these speeches, which might continue through the night till Gbudwe retired at dawn. The scene was described to me thus. Gbudwe is seated and his subjects are seated in a semicircle around him. One of his men, such as the commander of a company of unmarried warriors, steps forward, carefully arranges his barkcloth, and commences his speech:"																															91	No	"They proceeded on their way, and when they were far from Bazingbi’s home Gbudwe set his company of warriors across their path, and when they were all in the middle of the ambush they appeared before them to fight them; and they captured all their rifles and all their goods, and they killed many of them. However, part of them fled back to Bazingbi. They said to him, ‘Your sons attacked us on our way and they have killed indeed many and [Page 293] captured all our rifles.’ He said to them, ‘O my friends I cannot understand this attack on you. You see that all my sons are administering provinces, that is, those who make war on my behalf. If I had wanted to fight you I would have told it to one of my sons who has many followers. As for this youth, he is just a sister’s son and an idiot; he never listens to what I have to say to him. He came to reside near my court and began to gather followers around him. I have admonished him in vain, he pays no attention to what I say. He even wants to fight with me!’ The Arabs then returned to their home; and while they were there Bazingbi died. While he was dying he urged Gbudwe against the Arabs, saying to him that he must never leave them in peace. It was Gbudwe to whom Bazingbi gave his blessing, saying that he alone was to take his inheritance, because he had obeyed his words well, more than his brothers who had been given provinces."																															92	No	"Neither Ngima nor Ezo thrived in their kingdoms and both consulted the poison oracle about the advisability of their remaining in them. The oracle told both of them that if they stayed where they were misfortune would overtake them, so Ngima journeyed to the court of Ezo to suggest that they exchanged kingdoms, to which proposal Ezo agreed. When the news of this exchange spread, Ezo’s followers at court showed great indignation, for Ngima had a bad reputation among the Azande, and he was also considered to have been disobedient to his father. Ezo’s followers supported one of his courtiers of the Abakundo clan who told his king that they would never serve Ngima and upbraided him for letting his brother depart in peace. This courtier called upon the young warriors at court to follow him, and they ran after Ngima and beat him with sticks. They tied a stick to his member and twisted it round and round until it was in a terrible state, and so they left him. Ezo said nothing when he was told what had happened."																															93	No	"The success of Gbudwe in this war is partly attributed to his possession of a magic whistle called ngbuka anya, over which he had uttered a spell and which he then blew before the fighting commenced. This whistle had been a cherished possession of Bazingbi, who on his deathbed had charged Kilima of the Angumbi clan to hand it over to Gbudwe. For some reason this man did not give the whistle to Gbudwe, and no one knew what had happened to it till an old wife of Bazingbi came forward and told Gbudwe that it was in the possession of Kilima. This whistle remained with Gbudwe for the rest of his life, and on his death it was removed from his hut by one of his chief wives, Nanduru, who gave it to her son Gangura, who had it till his recent death."																															94	No	"Gbudwe ordered his followers to move towards the west. Mange then engaged the enemy. Gbudwe continued his advance. His two sons crumpled on the wings and fighting was concentrated in the centre. His men rushed into the fighting and they fought for a long time. Many of Gbudwe’s men were wounded, and many of Ngangi’s men were slain. The fighting became very fierce, and Ngangi gathered his riflemen and fled with them. They came and told Gbudwe ‘Ngangi has already fled.’ Gbudwe replied, ‘Not at all, onward to [Page 327] the fighting.’ They advanced in vain, for Ngangi fled to the Iba river. So Gbudwe ordered an advance on his home, and he went to stay there and he burnt all his huts. Gbudwe spent a long time there, and while he was there his men went off to seize the women of the country. Gbudwe ordered beer to be brewed that they might drink it and return home; and when they had finished drinking beer Gbudwe distributed women among his followers; and then they all arose to return home. Such is this history. It began with Bazingbi, who fought against the father of Ngangi, Muduba, and scattered his sons. Therefore Gbudwe had said that his father’s campaign was incomplete and that it would be well for him to finish it. Hence he went up against Ngangi."																															95	No	"When Bazingbi died Gbudwe took his place and ruled over his father’s subjects. He took the inheritance of his father on account of his strength, for he was the man who first made war on the Arabs. After the death of Bazingbi he made himself master of all his father’s territory. When he heard it said of a prince that he had many followers he made war against him, and he set one of his sons in his place to reside there and to rule over all who used to be his subjects. Thus Gbudwe prospered and became a great king, for he made war against any prince who opposed him. He only was a great king and continued as such. Gbudwe was a powerful and a daring man, for he overcame all princes, and for him alone they all became meek. After he had overcome them all he rested in peace; and he distributed provinces to all his sons, and he left it to them to make war against many peoples"																															96	No	"A further trouble met Gbudwe on his return. He found that certain persons, called Teri, Bogu, and Denegi, whose names [Page 344] suggest that they were Negro troops, had been left by Rafai with instructions to keep watch on him, and that they had built a small post near his court. 1 The details of what happened to these men are obscure. The country was still much disturbed, and many families had sought refuge in neighbouring kingdoms; and these included some of my best informants, who were consequently at that time no longer witnesses of events in Gbudwe’s kingdom. It seems that it was an unusually dry year and that Gbudwe, who had presumably come to the conclusion that it was better to fight the Arabs than to submit to them, summoned his sons to blockade the post. The besieged men dug deep for water, but in vain, and when their water-carriers went to near-by streams they were killed. It would seem that eventually, of the three leaders, Teri and Bogu were killed and Denegi fought his way out."																															97	No	"The chief significant points in the myth are those which attribute to the ancestor of the Avongara the qualities Azande emphasize as [Page 429] those distinguishing nobles and which are to a student of their political organization the basic functions of the ruling clan. These are, first, the settlement of disputes by clear judicial decisions, especially in cases of adultery, always of major importance to Azande, and secondly, liberality, especially in the distribution of food. Basenginonga attracts a following because the Angbapiyo and the Abakundo are unable, as he is able, to give clear decisions, and all the clans, unlike him, hide their game and eat in secret and away from their fellows. Minor points which mirror the Zande representation of their rulers are cleanliness and economy in eating, care in the preparation of food, eating apart from commoners, and a certain distinction and withdrawal from common touch. The founder is also, in one version, the inventor of war, who distributes among his followers the weapons of war. In the myth the founder of the royal clan acts exactly as a king or prince acts today. He listens attentively to cases and gives unambiguous verdicts; he provides food for his followers at court, fresh, well cooked, and in quantity; and he makes war and distributes weapons to be used in it."																															98	No	"Some of his actions may strike us as being ruthless or savage, but Azande point out that it requires a strong hand to rule them. They admired also the frankness of his severity, for he attained his ends openly and not with the secrecy and slyness which, his subjects say, Wando and his son Renzi employed, nor did he practice, or allow others to practice, the insane cruelties carried out on the orders of some princes, notably Mvuto son of Ndoruma. Nor have I ever heard subjects accuse him of injustice, though they accused other princes of it. They say that, on the contrary though he ordered many executions (in fact, I have never been able to obtain details of more than a few, and I think Azande exaggerate the number) he often allowed a man whom he might have slain to pay a fine instead; and he saved from death men whom his courtiers wanted to kill. It is evident also that in the case of some brutal executions they were carried out in his name but without his authorization, for absolute monarch though he was, if his followers killed a man for some offence in his name he was compelled to accept the situation. His best friend, the commoner governor Zengendi, was killed without his knowledge. Moreover, powerful though he was, he had only limited means of controlling what happened outside his court, and there can be no doubt that influential men sometimes bullied those whom they administered in his name, especially such persons, mostly members of subjugated tribes, who never came to court and had no one there to represent their interests. It seems that Gbudwe took the view that it served them right if they stayed away from court and the polished society which frequented it and were ignorant and stupid enough to hide like wild beasts in the bush. Some discipline was required to civilize these barbarians and it was to impose it that he entrusted his sons and elders with administration under his authority. What went on in the provinces ruled by his sons was none of his affair, unless his [Page 93] own immediate subjects were involved. If we are to have sympathy for any of Gbudwe’s followers it should, I think, be for some of his old commoner governors, whom, so far as I could understand, he sometimes ousted from their positions somewhat arbitrarily, and occasionally executed, and then replaced them by his own sons; but all kings did the same; Azande regarded the appointment of a commoner to a governorship as a political hazard.The Azande also liked him because he was not too self-conscious, was unpretentious in his demeanour, and did not humiliate them. They say that he did not laugh often partly because he was of a morose temperament but also partly because of a habit cultivated by princes of hiding their teeth and the interior of their mouths from the gaze of the public; so when Gbudwe was amused he would give a little cough, half cough and half laugh, and smile, putting at the same time his hand or his fly-whisk up to his mouth to cover it, a customary modesty on the part of royalty. But they add that Gbudwe, who showed none of the aloofness of his son Mange and his brother-in-law Tembura and of other princes in the presence of their subjects, would on occasions shout and laugh so that everyone could see his mouth and teeth, whereas Mange and Basongoda kept their hands incessantly before their mouths, partly because their teeth were not so good, but mainly to shield themselves from their subjects. It was the custom of some kings, of whom Tembura was one, to have a trumpeter standing at their side to trumpet whenever they laughed, the sound of the trumpet being called ‘the king’s laughter’. Likewise, Gbudwe would never be carried on the shoulders of his subjects as were his son Gumba and his grandson Kipa, who seldom walked in public. I was told that his elder brother Wando and some other of the princes in what is now the Belgian Congo never walked in their kingdoms but were always carried on the shoulders of servants. Gbudwe considered this practice foolish. Nor did he exact the crawling obeisance which some princes received from their subjects, though probably only those on [Page 95] the periphery of Zandeland where the vast majority of the population were conquered peoples or their descendants, and not in the heart of Zandeland where the Ambomu, or true Azande, element was more considerable. Gbudwe was treated with far less formal subservience by his followers than were his sons Mange and Rikita, his cousin Tembura son of Liwa, and, according to some accounts, of Kipa son of Ndeni, by theirs. The subjects of these kings were mostly conquered foreigners. Court custom in their kingdoms prescribed that a man who wished to speak with the king or make a case before him should crawl from a long distance to approach him. Gbudwe’s erstwhile subjects have told me that it might be all right for barbarians ( auro) to humiliate themselves in this way but that Gbudwe would never have permitted the true Azande of his court to act in so undignified a manner—they bent only slightly when approaching him—and had he done so they would have left him to follow princes with more respect for the traditional relationship between noble and commoner. Relations between king and subject at court are said to have been less formal still at the courts of Gbudwe’s elder brothers Wando and Malingindo.Gbudwe was a stickler for tradition, and in this he was naturally supported by the older men and the chief commoner families. He refused to imitate those princes who dressed like Arabs. Indeed he was hostile to anything the Arabs did, and he always spoke contemptuously of them. Any form of magic was intolerable to him unless it had been known to his father. He approved of witch-doctors ( abinza) and other diviners ( aboro atoro) and summoned them to divine for him, and he sent for the female leech Nambili to treat the ailments of his wives. Many forms of magic employed by Azande today, were not known to Gbudwe’s subjects during his lifetime, and of those that were known one can count on the fingers of one’s hands those of which he is said to have approved: warmagic, vengeance-magic, thunder-magic against wrongdoers, secrecy-magic ( gbau) to aid the pursuit of vengeance, hunting-magic ( bingiya), medicines for closing gardens against theft, magic for the protection of the person ( zuna), medicines for increasing crops, medicines to increase sexual potency, and medicines to attract followers. He used some of these forms of magic himself, getting old commoners to bring the medicines and perform the rites, except in the case of the war-medicines, which he administered himself, from the large bongo horn in which they were kept, to his [Page 96] elders and his company commanders. He was suspicious of all kinds of magic other than those I have mentioned, and his hostility to some of those used by people in the kingdoms to the south of his own was probably the main reason for their not having entered his kingdom—such bad medicines as togoligaka and ngwa gberesa kpolo—by his subjects until after his death. The medicine he disliked most was menzere, a medicine used in sorcery, and I was told that if anyone were known to possess it his death was certain. He refused to condone the practices of the magical secret societies which were entering Zandeland during the last few years of his life. He is said to have destroyed the lodges and the members of the only one which gained a footing in his own country. I was told that he even frowned on such reputable medicines as the zelengbongo whistle, which a man blows to kill anyone who may be injuring him. Gbudwe is said to have asked why a man should have recourse to a magical whistle for protection when he gave all the protection against injury that a man could desire, and to have expressed the opinion that all this blowing of whistles only led to trouble. Nevertheless, he wore one or two whistles of an old type on his person."																															99	No	"Such scenes of cold-blooded murder, if we can accept the relation of them, are out of keeping with the character of a Zande king. Some kings may indeed have ordered executions and cruel punishments of commoners for trivial offences or for their personal advantage, but I have never heard of such behaviour as Piaggia describes. It is true that a passage in Schweinfurth’s account suggests that kings occasionally behaved in such a manner: ‘The deflant imperious bearing of the chiefs alone constitutes their outward dignity, and there are some who in majestic deportment and gesture might vie with any potentate of the earth. The dread with which they inspire their subjects is incredible: it is said that for the purpose of exhibiting their power over life and death they will occasionally feign fits of passion, and that, singling out a victim from the crowd, they will throw a rope about his neck, and with their own hands cut his throat with one stroke of their jagged scimitar.’ 2 But Schweinfurth makes it clear that he did not witness this, and it seems probable that he was recounting what his Arab friends had told him or possibly that he here, as I think everywhere, made use of Piaggia’s account. The only other early writer who describes a Zande king executing people with his own hands is Captain Burrows, a British officer who served in the Belgian Administration of the Congo from 1894 to 1898. He writes: ‘The Azandé generally kill condemned criminals with the lance. I remember once an Azandé chief caught one of his wives attempting to run away with another man. They were both taken and brought back, and next morning, before an assembly of the people summoned to witness the ceremony they were tied to trees. The chief himself, after haranging the assembled multitude, at a distance of fifty yards from the prisoners, began to dance, stopping every now and then to throw a lance at either the [Page 99] woman or the man. This he continued to do, approaching nearer and nearer, until both culprits had been transfixed by two or three lances. A chief would not hesitate to mutilate his own son for such an outrage, inflicting the usual penalty by cutting off both hands at the wrists.’ 1 This passage suggests that Burrows witnessed the event, but it is not clear why, if such was the case, he did not prevent it."																															100	No	"Romolo Gessi Pasha, the heroic governor of the Bahr al-Ghazal in the years 1878 to 1880, has left us a description of Ndoruma, whom he calls Mdarama, son of Ezo. Writing in 1879, he says. ‘About a month ago news came to Dem Suleiman that a great Sandeh chief was on his way with a numerous suite. I gave orders that he should be received with due honour, and festive preparations were made. Mdarama soon arrived. He is a man about thirty-five years of age, more than six feet high, well proportioned, with broad shoulders, intelligent expression and a perpetual smile. He [Page 100] examined our Remington rifles, the cannon, and the dêpots of ammunition and cloths with the greatest curiosity. He then presented me with forty large [elephant] tusks. I gave orders that he should choose some clothing from our stores. He was shown the best Arab clothes, but said that he wished to be dressed like a Frank [European], for he was no Jelabba [Arab trader]. Then he wished to see a cannon fired, and I hastened to gratify him, but when the piece went off he fell to the ground from fear.’ 1"																															101	No	"Perhaps the king best described in the literature whom Junker met was Bazingbi’s son Wando, whom Schweinfurth had met ten years earlier. His son Fero or Renzi presented himself to Junker on November 10th 1880 and told him that his father was too fat to walk any great distance but hoped to see Junker on his route to Ndoruma’s. 3 This is how Junker describes their meeting: ‘At one of these groups of huts were several hundred Zandehs, among whom [Page 104] I was at once able to single out the aged Wando by his corpulent figure. Like all members of the old Zandeh dynasty, he despised princely adornments, and even his rokko [barkcloth] was no better than those of his surrounding followers. "																															102	No	"Under colonial rule, and even where the British preference for indirect rule"" held sway"	 this political system inevitably decayed.

In case of refusal, the chief causes the arrest of all the members of the family of the offender and confiscates their possessions.

In the case of repetition, they are executed and their wives are confiscated for the benefit of the chief."																															107	No	"“Bakangai [JMA: A Zande chief south of the Bomokandi] had the reputation of a strict ruler, and, like so many powerful chiefs of the black race, he frequently inflicted capital punishment on his subjects.

Shortly before my arrival, two of his wives had suffered death, but I was also informed that the despot now lived in fear of my censure. This is another proof of the great respect which even the absolute rulers of those lands have for the judgment of Europeans. With all their bluster they still appear to have a secret dread of perhaps having done something wrong according to our views; so far is this feeling carried that they prefer to keep altogether from our knowledge such cases of capital punishment, as they do the practice of cannibalism.”"																															108	No	"The chief is the absolute master of his chiefdom. The chiefdom is hereditary in the line of the eldest son. A daughter is never able to succeed, women having nothing to do with politics. Before death, the chief designates his successor, who is normally the eldest son. If the chief decides that his eldest son is incompetent or unworthy, it is legal for him to designate another of his sons. Very often, in order to avoid conflicts, he divides his territory and his authority among two or three of his sons, generally the eldest. Often also he gives a good part to one of his brothers who [17] has remained very faithful. History teaches us, however, that it was very rare that the death of a chief did not lead to a war of succession. The sons, and often even one or another of the brothers of the dead chief, hardly content with the situation which had been made for them, took up arms and attempted to gain the supremacy. The Azande, in taking action or cause for one or the other of the pretenders, contributed to place on the throne the candidate who had their sympathy. One might say that the testament of a dying chief favored the disintegration of the chiefdom. On the contrary, the wars of succession eliminated the candidates who did not have the sympathies of the Azande, and put in front the Avongara, sons or brothers of the dead chief who excelled by their bravery and were able to count as supporters the largest number of cohorts. It is thus that, during the course of history, the great Azande chiefdoms were formed.At the death of the chief, his successor takes the reins of government without any [Page 16-17(2)] ceremony whatsoever. His title of elder son or of successor designated by the deceased chief suffices. A war dance by an immense crowd of followers gathered at the court makes the investiture ceremony official."																															109	No	"The chief establishes his village in the middle of his territory. Very often the situation is strategically chosen: back to back to a very marshy river, at the edge of an open plain which permits no surprise, it is protected by palisades and surrounded by enormous plantations. In the middle of these plantations one encounters, spread out in a semicircle, ranges of round huts where live the body guards and the palanga (young men). Then comes the ngbwanga, or the court of the palaver, where, under the large sheds, they hold the assemblies of the notables and the courts of law.More distant, separated by a light palisade, extends the barondo, a place reserved alone for the nobles called personally by the chief. Without the barondo, we find the ngbwadimo, the private harem of the chief where the houses of the women and slaves are visible. No one is permitted to be in the ngbwadimo of the chief.From this agglomeration lead off a series of paths which ramify gradually to join the villages of the great bakumba or the grand vassals of the chief. The latter are generally the relatives of the chief and rule over a part of the territory. Sometimes the chief divides the territory between two or three of his sons during his lifetime, who remain the vassals of their father, but will be lords in regard to the bakumba. [18]"																															110	No	"Moreover, each vassal is compelled to present himself often to the chief, either that he submit differences or difficulties of the political order, or that he come simply to make him a visit of courtesy and give homage. If one of them does not come often enough, in the mind of the chief, to take part in general affairs, the latter will call him, or even go to him, where he will install himself with a numerous suite for several days in order to take account of what had occurred in that territory.This system of organization presented great advantages in the time of past conquests, in that then the bulk of the population belonged to the race recently subjugated. In order to hold these foreign people in their power, the chief distributed in his territory [19] a series of bakumba, [deputies] each supported by a small troop of Zande warriors. If the population submitted with good will they were treated as part of the conquering race, and even, at times, received at the end of a certain period, as bakumba, a descendant of their old chiefs. In all of these regions the official language became, bit by bit, Zande. These peoples ended even by adopting Zande dress, to a point where we actually find a surprising homogeneity.There was, moreover, a unity of direction. In the assemblies of old men or nobles who were the bakumba, the chief conferred with all the officials who convened. He demanded in any case the advice of his bakumba, but he never let himself be won over by them and always reserved the liberty to veto questions with complete independence."																															111	No	"The right to declare war belongs to the chief. After having consulted the oracle, he calls together the bakumba (deputies) at his residence. They arrive with a few warriors. The chief explains to them the reasons which force him to take up arms, and he assures himself that he can count on their complete devotion and their bravery. The greater or lesser enthusiasm of the bakumba resolve the chief whether he can go ahead or whether he had better abandon the warlike enterprise.If the chief sees that he can count on his men, he sends a delegation to the enemy chief and has a broken lance sent to him. The enemy chief finds himself with the choice of whether to return the defy or to give way to the exigencies of his adversary. The man who carries the lance is never molested."																															112	No	"Among the Azande, the chief is the sole representative of judiciary power. There is no other judge but the chief of the territory. Custom permits no person to intervene in the regulation of the palavers, to be treated by the chief. The chief is not obligated to ask advice from anyone.In fact, when the cause is very grave, he asks at times the advice of the principal nobles. That never occurs in public in the palaver-court, but in the barondo, the reserve court where the chief convenes with various personages. If the chief consults someone, it is because he believes it best. The consultation is not supposed to exist. No noble has the right to be consulted if he has not a part of the territory to govern and if it does not concern one of his men.The under chiefs or the great nobles to whom the supreme chief has entrusted a part of his territory to govern, have, on this account, the right to settle the differences of the people of their provinces. They only settle, in short, those cases without special importance. Nevertheless, the native has always the right to reintroduce his cause to the supreme chief, who settles it then as a last resort. The sub-chief or the great bakumba always refers the important affairs to the supreme chief. For all, the cases where the chief is personally involved he rules as seems best to him, in conformity with his own interests. Formerly the chiefs had the right of life [21] and death over their subjects, and they made use of it a great deal. In cases of this nature, the nobles of the territory feel, in spite of all, the need to approve of their chief, so that exactions were not rare.The competence of the chief is unlimited. Custom determines in most cases what penalty to inflict. In the occurrence [JMA: of a crime] it is merely a constant manner and habit of the chief to consider the case in hand. The will of the chief is law. The laws, nevertheless, are made with good sense, being derived from the approved customs by all the group. The chiefs do not swerve from the customary rules that their predecessors have introduced. It is in their eyes an element of peace and order."																															113	No	"There is no procedure properly speaking. The chiefs listen to both parties who defend themselves as they are able, and pronounce judgment. For the cases more or less grave or contradictory, they have recourse to the benge oracle, which occurs in the presence of some nobles. The native oath exists also. One swears by “the leg of the chief”. If the chief, within a rather short space of time, is hurt on the foot, even slightly, it is a sign that one had made a false oath. The chief contents himself with the native oath when the affair is of little import, but if the cause is grave, he has recourse to the oracle. One can easily see that the judgment based on the oracle of augury, in addition to sufficiently objective proofs, brings condemnation to many innocents."																															114	No	"Formerly, in the Azande chiefdom, the chief was completely dependent upon himself. He was the soul of his people. He was the incarnation of his ancestors who were illustrious in memorable wars. He was the judge who restrained crime and the guardian of the public morality. The chief was loved as much as he was feared. The situation has changed. The European occupation put an end to warlike incursions and the judgments of the chief, formerly irrevocable, are nowadays revisable and reformable. The grand sultan of the Avongara, the autocratic chief, has become a subordinate who receives orders and is rebuked for the failure of the directions given to him, at times harshly, even in public and in the presence of his men, by an agent or a functionary who says the opposite of that said by his predecessor. A painful situation when it occurs, for a chief who has never had to obey and who now submits to cruel humiliations.The Azande, who were all convinced that only the Avongara were capable and worthy of governing their territory, have no longer for their chief, especially if they have traveled far, these marks of respect which he produced in them formerly. The former rigor has disappeared and with it, it must be said, the salutary fear which it inspired. On the other hand, the authority of the chief is resented. The chiefs complain that the [Page 25-26(2)] natives do not obey them as formerly and no longer respect the wives of others. Shamelessness has developed. The women who, under the new regime, can no longer receive corporal punishment, have become very unstable. Wickedness is great and is complained of. To put an end to cruelties is certainly a humanitarian work to effect, but if the Zande chiefdoms are to be saved, in which [26] at all times, all initiative comes from above, that is to say, from the chief, there is a need for instructing the chief in his new duties and aiding him, sooner than humiliating him publicly. The humiliation is all the more painful and leads to greater shame when it is caused by an agent whom one knows occupies the lowest position in the hierarchy."																															115	No	"Formerly the members of the clan lived in a group stretched out along the banks of a river. The large clans comprised several of these groups. During the period of invasions the Avongara chiefs took care not to break them up. Good diplomats, they showed themselves to be very generous and often permitted these people a sub-chief of the same clan on the conditions of furnishing to the chief, warriors, provisions, and women. In proportion, as the stability of the territory increased so that the wars against their neighbors became less common, the Avongara chiefs became more authoritorian. More and more they abused the collective responsibility of the members of the various clans. These had all tried quietly to separate themselves from the risk of conflict with members of other clans. Many even, when a great quarrel had arisen in regard to the crime of a member of the clan, entered into the territory of neighboring chiefs. This sort of flight was most dangerous, for a stranger in the chiefdom, even be he a true Zande, could only escape slavery and often death by becoming a blood brother of some member of that territory. This person took the fugitives under his protection and went to present them to the chief of the territory. The chief accepted them rather willingly, only wishing that he have the largest number of men possible. It is thus that little by little the local groups of clan members were broken up, the dispersion not only occurring within the territory of a single chief, but extending into the territory of the neighboring chiefs. The exactions of the Avongara and the collective responsibility of [Page 34(2)] the members of the clan has destroyed the agglomerations."																															116	No	"The court of the chief is composed of three very distinct parts: 1) the public quarter, called mgbwanga, where the [159] people gather to set their palavers before the chief; 2) the barondo, a reserved place where the chief carries on general business with the great persons of the chiefdom; 3) the private residence of the chief, with the harem, called mgbwadimo."																															117	No	"Very old chiefs are more careful to isolate their harems. Fearing that their wives will seek to eliminate them by means of poison, these old chiefs often figure that there is advantage in giving a bit of air to their wives or else plenty of latitude. They construct the houses of their wives near the public quarter, reserving a corner where people cannot present themselves without authorization and which serves as the barondo."																															118	No	"In the harem of the chief there are two main categories of women: wives and slaves.		The slaves are the women taken in war which have been given to the chief, either in payment for a crime or for a palaver. These women are all at the service of the chiefs’ wives. Formerly, the chief could not have relations with them. At any time it was legal for him to liberate one and raise her to the rank of his wives. Certain chiefs, formerly, lent certain of these women to the service of ordinary visitors. For this reason they were called adegbere, that is, women of the dance, because it was legal for them to associate in nocturnal dances in the public quarter, to which the chief did not lend assistance in ordinary times.Among the wives of the chief, there were multiple categories. First, the nagbiya (lit.: mother of the chief) who is either the mother of the chief or the preferred wife. She has the highest position of watching over the harem. If there are many wives, there are several nagbiya, each watching over a part of the harem. [160]There follows next the nagili, who are the preferred wives of the chief. They have the privilege of not having to work, of remaining by the side of the chief and following him in his movements [from place to place].Among the workers are the tibenagbiya (lit.: at the hand of the mother of the chief), the women who are under the immediate direction of the nagbiya and at her disposal for various kinds of work. There are among them the nagbindi, the appointed cooks, who [Page 159-160(2)] prepare food for the visitors. One of them is in charge of preparing the food of the chief, who always eats alone.Finally, the tibeadiyabiya (at the hand of the wives of the chief), the ordinary workers. These have at their disposal the slaves ( akanga), as well as all non-nubile girls, the musonosi and the wilimofu, the children which the chief has received gratuitously from his men (lit.: child of the gift)."																															119	No	"Chiefs often have secondary homesteads. These are many of the homesteads built for the facility of the administration, or rather ancient homesteads where there is still a group of wives of the chief, of different categories, under the direction of a nagbiya. These women are often called nangbwasolo (lit.: mother of the mouth of the granary)."																															120	No	"The wives of the chief, if one excepts certain preferred ones, are in short, servants whose work consists of preparing food, beer, and subsidiarily, work in the plantations of the chief. We do not forget that the work in the plantation is done in great part by the palanga, young men who come to pass several years in the service of the chief and live in small round huts at the entrance to the public quarter. The chief can requisition travelers for all work he deems necessary. He can also requisition food of all sorts. The wives of the chief, in working thus to feed and entertain the visitors, collaborated to increase his popularity and even his prestige. Occasionally they remembered that in fact this chief was their husband. At long intervals, in view of their number, each among them could share for a few days the couch of their glorious husband and master. Except for this, they were condemned to forced celibacy, forced to seek in their companions by immoral means, that which they could not find in their so-called family residence."																															121	No	"The sons can commit incest with one of their free sisters, but they had to respect the wives of the chief. I know of a chief who has disinherited his own son for such a crime. The adult sons of the chief do not dare to enter the enclosure reserved for the women of their father without his consent. [163] The only ones who can enter more or less freely are petty servants, or inoffensive mutilated individuals [ gabagaba] that the chief chooses to transmit orders to his wives.To acclaim the new chief, the people shoot off guns and commence a mimic battle to show the chief that he can have confidence in them.After this ceremony the chief makes a distribution of food, knives, and also sometimes of slaves.		The new chief busies himself with discovering who was responsible [222] for the death of his father, and calls the notables together to consult the benge oracle. If a great notable is accused, he is killed in private, if a commoner, he is killed openly. All the family of the guilty one is subject to vengeance. The men are all killed, and the women taken to the chief as slaves."																															123	No	"A sub-Chief, on being given a country, would install himself wherever the omens showed that he would be fortunate. They alone would guide him in his choice. He would then take stock of his neighbours, and place his most loyal headmen on that side of his territory which he felt was the most likely to be filched from him, or to suffer trespass by the subjects of his rival. He would not tolerate any such immigrants, unless they renounced their Chief and acknowledged him as their overlord. Over the rest of his country he would appoint headmen, sometimes defining the boundaries of their authority, but not always.”"																															124	No	"Only the paramount Chief, and one or two of his biggest viceroys, had the power to pass a death sentence. The sub-chiefs, and any other notables to whom the paramount Chief might have given authority to hear cases, could not do so."																															125	No	"Since the commencement of relations between the populations of the Bomu, Sueh, Uele and Bomokandi, and the Arabs of the Nile, or with European merchants (Piagga, Petterich and others), the traffic in ivory has been monopolized in the hands of the chiefs.One can then affirm that, the arrival of the traders was the occasion for the chief not to monopolize the ivory but to monopolize to his own profit, trade with the foreigner."																															126	No	"The chief indicates or has indicated to each bakumba--with a view to the total occupation of his territory,--in which administrative subdivsion ( capita) he shall establish himself. This occupation being completed, the intervention of the chief does not again occur. The Zande from then on chooses at his will, the site, always isolated, where he will establish his kpwolo (3), which he will move also, for motives of which [Page 600-604d] he alone is the judge and which will not be invalidated by the desire of a third, even though the third were the chief. [602]"																															127	No	"By right, the chief would assume guard of the palm grove and exploit it, placing here one of his clients, regarded as a slave. In this way, he does not make a fiscal transaction, an appropriation res nullius. He respects, on the contrary, the property of the [Page 600-604g] deceased and administers his estate. Not being of his descendants, he cannot inherit it. The role of the chief in the Zande nation, as I have been assured, is to see that the rights of the dead (thus the spirits), are respected, like those of the living."																															128	No	"Beer was the supreme item of the market place and in a category by itself. In some of the large markets it was given a place of its own and in the larger towns beershops, open daily, were being established [Page 541] at the time of my observations. As with flour, the sale of beer rendered an important service as well as refreshment, for the brewing of beer is women’s work. If a man does not have a wife or a female relative who will brew for him, he is dependent upon the hospitality of others and upon the beer for sale in the markets. Moreover, beer is much more than food and drink, for it is the universal social lubricant, without which hospitality is not possible and convivality difficult. A household’s influence depends upon its ability to give beer to its guests. Traditionally a chief or any important man had to have an unlimited supply of beer and food for visitors. Even now a man is judged by the amount of food which he can afford to give away. As one old man put it, when I commented upon the extraordinary size of his granary, “If a man has a lot of beer to give to people, they will come to listen to his good advice.”"																															129	No	"The process of consolidation of the Pax Azandea was the more remarkable as this did not acquire the political form of an empire. At no time since chief Ngura has it been headed by one paramount ruler. The Avongara chiefs, as a clan, were the undisputed rulers of the Azande, but they were divided amongst themselves. As the territory under their rule grew, they administered [Page 9] it by delegating their power to sons and brothers. These vassals quarrelled, formed alliances, fought against one another, dethroned a weak elder brother in a war of succession, re-created sub-empires, but still continued to expand the Pax Azandea, until this took the form of an ‘agglomerate of divers peoples belonging to different ethnographic and linguistic families subject to one group who gives their language and organization to the vanquished’"																															130	No	"Azande living on their chief’s territory paid him tribute in kind, and the young warriors, in time of peace, worked for the chief. How far these tributes, whether in kind or in labour, were connected with an economic territorial ownership conception, I have neither been able to find in literature nor during my survey."																															131	No	"The degree of power which a chief wages over his subjects has probably varied during the historical periods which have been enumerated. To the earliest authors, who have seen the Zande society yet untouched by slave-raids and fire-arms, the power of the chief seemed absolute in the case of war or legal judgement, but far from absolute in matters of labour relationship, with the exception of the custom of the labour tribute by young warriors [1 c], whereas after the Gbudwe period, the chief’s power seems absolute in every respect."																															132	No	"From my own observations, less despotic power is required for either sending people into war or executing them, than for obliging them to work. The decision of an execution, as well as a declaration of war in primitive Africa, had often the support of public opinion worked up to the pitch of hysteria and the chief derived an advantage by fulfilling a popular desire, which may have sprung from sadism or from a feeling of a threatened security. On the contrary, in order to maintain forced labour, a chief must have the strength to go directly against the interests and dispositions of the people, and this requires the exercise of constant despotic power [35]35. Attitude observed during the Lodjo poison trials in Faradje (Belgian Congo).Go to end note page. It seems likely that this last form of despotism was acquired by Avongara chiefs only during the last period of their history."																															133	No	"Environmental coercion can be spoken of as the direct or primary one and social or cultural coercion as the indirect or secondary one. The latter being still diffuse at a subsistence level, it takes the form of social sanctions by reciprocity, in which each individual forces the other into the customary pattern of behaviour by fulfilling and by requiring the fulfilment of mutual customary obligations. At a further step of development, when division of labour and specialization become further developed, professions of law-making, law-interpreting and law-enforcing are organized. In the Zande society such professions already exist in the form of the political government of the Avongara chiefs. Their influence is, however, still superficial and in terms of agriculture economic reciprocity is by far the more important social sanction."																															134	No	"A certain amount of effort is required by the chief. His buildings must also be hurriedly repaired and his early groundnuts must be sown. He has sufficient reserves of seeds to risk early sowings. The earth is still dry and a Zande would not hoe it for his own fields because of the dust raised by the hoe, but if he gets [Page 156] orders from the Avongara he will suffer the dust and do the work. The groundnuts will be sown a first time into dry soil just in case it rains and; if it does not, they will have to be resown, but, if it does, the chief will have the earliest crop of groundnuts in the country."																															135	No	"Orders from the chiefs are also received for another work, the purpose of which is not clear at all. One has to pull out all the cotton stalks and burn them. In actual fact the order was received long ago and the last date of tolerance was 28th February, but at that time people had just finished picking and selling cotton and had hurried away to catch some fish. So the sanitary clean-up has been delayed."																															136	No	"Next to protective magic, a potent social control is the oracle, which is believed to enable a magician to find out the culprit of any [Page 186] crime which has been committed and to enable the chief’s court to punish the criminal. From our point of view this procedure may appear highly immoral, as possibly many innocent people suffer from it. But it cannot be denied that, as a belief shared by every member of a group, it has the social effect of preventing many crimes and, therefore, of increasing the economic security of the group."																															137	No	"Once the oracle has been consulted, whether rubbing board, poison oracle or others, the family has no doubt about its decision. [Page 194] It may induce them to move to a neighbouring stream or, nowadays, to ask the headman for a new holding in the same line, or else it may oblige them to ask the chief for permission to go to a different headman, a different subchief, even to another chief in a distant area. Usually the chief does not protest. Only if many of his people desert him, unwilling to admit his unpopularity, he will declare the oracle’s pronouncement to be falsified. He will then consult his own oracle, which may indicate to his subject another site within his own jurisdiction. The chief’s oracle will be considered as final and there is no appeal from it."																															138	No	"The diffuse distribution of homesteads in bush clearings was partly an adaptation to economic needs. The Zande is essentially an agriculturalist, he possesses no cattle and game is not plentiful; since he often works a plot of land only two years in succession he needs a considerable area, of which part will be under cultivation part fallow, and part returning temporally to bush. In such an area each householder had his own supply of ant hills, his beds of edible fungus, and his supply of wild plants and herbs, while in the vicinity was his private hunting territory. Each homestead was an economic unit, and though there were no village settlements the locality presided over by a deputy chief formed a social group; the householders were all familiar with one another, while near neighbours were usually closely related, for parents liked their children to settle near them when they married. Besides the ties due to blood and marriage within a given locality, there were others formed by [Page 500] common membership of other social groups, such as those created by circumcision, blood-brotherhood, and secret societies. Thus the followers of a single deputy chief formed a body in which there was considerable social cohesion."																															139	No	"Succession to political leadership is in the male line and is rigidly restricted to one class, the Avongara, often regarded as of foreign origin, though there is no evidence for this and there is a myth in which it is stated that they spring from Zande stock. The social weakness of the Zande clan organization, probably due primarily to the absence of strong local groups, is increased by the existence of this class of chiefs."																															140	No	"Long ago there were no chiefs, though the Abökunde clan possessed a certain predominance, the Vongara clan being then known as Akulangba. A man of this clan married a woman of the Abökunde, by whom he had a son named Basenginonga, who when adolescent went to live with his maternal uncle. One day Basenginonga followed an adultery case in which his uncle gave the surprising verdict that both the disputants were right This so shocked Basenginonga that he spoke out, declaring that this was a bad judgment, for the men would resume their quarrel on the way home since both would say, “The chief said I was right.” Therefore, Basenginonga heard the case himself, and ordered one party to pay 20 spears damages. His decision met with public approval, so that the people began to take their disputes to him, his maternal uncle willingly acquiescing, and so from Basenginonga has sprung a line of chiefs.A similar story relates how the Abökunde used to go hunting with their sister’s son, Basenginonga, a renowned hunter. When the Abökunde killed they used to eat the meat themselves, but when Basenginonga was successful he feasted his visitors with the meat, to which he added great bowls of gruel. As his reputation for generosity grew, his followers likewise increased in numbers, and these brought their disputes before him and accepted his decisions because of their merits.Though scarcely historical, these legends may well reproduce actual happenings, and do embody the attitude of the Azande towards their chiefs, which is one of implicit obedience. If a Zande be asked why he is subservient to his chief he will reply that the chiefs are generous, or that they are courageous in settling disputes and do not mind giving their decisions quickly and straightly. The process of winning over followers by hospitality, justice, character, and prestige, is called in Zande ka zoga aboro. Thus it was that even in the old days if a man considered himself unfairly treated he could move into the territory of another chief and transfer his allegiance, the popularity of a chief depending mainly on his reputation for justice and generosity.Under their Vongara chiefs the Azande overran the savanna of the Sudan from the area of the Mbomu river, colonizing and assimilating the tribes of the vast territory now characterized by the Azande language and political institutions. Ambitious sons and [Page 503] brothers of paramount chiefs carved out independent kingdoms for themselves by conquering new territory and bringing foreign peoples into subjection. This was sometimes accomplished by warfare, in which the Azande were generally successful, but sometimes the inhabitants were induced to accept their new rulers peacefully."																															141	No	"The system of administration was always the same. The chiefs of the conquered people would often be regarded as deputy chiefs and their sons educated at the court of their lord, who in his rule scarcely differentiated between his fellow countrymen and his foreign subjects; a condition of prosperity ensued, and more and more Azande spread into the occupied area. The mutual cohesion of these kingdoms depended mainly on the character of the paramount lord, for there was always a tendency for the brother or son of the chief who acted as provincial governor to break away, while at the death of the ruler the country was plunged into civil war until one of his sons established himself as successor.A chief must be succeeded by a son or brother, but apart from this there is no precise rule of succession and a younger son may be chosen in preference to his elder brother if he be considered more intelligent. The chief’s deputy, bakumba, is appointed by the district, not the paramount chief, and is not a Vongara. Although the boundaries of his territory are but roughly defined there is no doubt as to the deputy to whom each man is subject, for the relationship is personal and not territorial."																															142	No	"In the old days the chief organized the war party, decided the number of fighting men, the order of battle, the use of magic, the disposal of prisoners, etc., but during the actual fighting he remained in the rear protected by a bodyguard of picked men. In peace time his principal rôle is to determine disputes and order punishment in important cases, for he alone can sit in judgment and only his oracle tests are official. Quarrels that can be decided at once on circumstantial evidence are settled on the spot by the chief, while disputes about which hangs an element of doubt are decided by oracle tests, carried out under the orders of the chief by his special diviners."																															143	No	"Disloyalty to a chief, striking any member of the Avongara, speaking against the ruler, using magic against him, having sexual intercourse with his wives, were offences whose penalty was death. The offender would be summoned to the chief’s court and there hacked to pieces by his servants."																															144	No	"The military organization maintained by the chiefs has naturally been much curtailed, though it still functions in the provision of labour for the chief’s gardens. It was, however, so important from the social point of view that some description is necessary."																															145	No	"In the marriage of chiefs a different code exists. When the chief takes commoner wives he pays spears in the usual way, but his relatives-in-law become his faithful retainers; it may please him to be generous to them, but he need not fear that they will side with his wife in a quarrel as the relatives-in-law of a commoner might. The greater the number of his wives the larger his sphere of influence."																															146	No	"Government. --There are no chiefs, councils, or any other formal governing bodies in a pygmy camp. In making any decisions concerning the whole camp, two factors are involved. The first of these is respect for older people.A pygmy will always, in addressing a man of an older age group in any formal situation, call him “senior”; he will listen respectfully to an older man and will always obey any reasonable orders he may give. If a younger man shows disrespect, the other members of the camp will gang up on him and berate him. This respect for age, and for the opinions of wise old men, is the basis of pygmy government.Secondly, while the opinions of most of the old men are respected, every man in the camp is entitled to state his own views on any subject. Thus, during the evening talking time, the pygmies will discuss whether to move camp, where to move it, and why; or whether to go net hunting, and where to hunt. The discussion has no leader and may go on for several evenings. Finally the men who are shouting out different opinions will come to an agreement and the decision will be acted upon.In general it is the older and more experienced men who make the decision, but as some of the old men are considered eccentrics and freaks, little attention is paid to them. Rather, it is an oligarchy of the more respected among the old men, a body with no formal membership or specific composition. In their decisions the pungent remarks of the women also have a considerable influence."																															147	No	"None of the foregoing material is much concerned with leadership, and, indeed, it has been scarcely necessary to mention it. Some of the early sources, such as Casati (1891), Burrows (1898), Geil (1905), and Lang (1919) assert the existence of hereditary chieftainship; others (Johnston, 1902, 1904; Christy, 1924) deny this just as emphatically. Stuhlmann (1894), referring to bands of Mbuti living near the Manyema, states that the leader of each band is the ablest hunter and that he controls the wanderings of his hand. Whether or not he has any other jurisdiction is not known.Schebesta flatly denies the existence of hereditary chieftainship anywhere among the Mbuti, except among those most acculturated. He also denies the existence of charismatic [Page [p.185-a]] leadership among the Mbuti except very rarely. He himself discusses the lineage elders ( “Sippenal¨testen ,” Schebesta, 1948, 332, 559) and states that lineage authority lies with these elders alone. Under villager influence these elders may assume the characteristics of a chief (cf. the “Sultani” of the Pygmies, mentioned by Geil, 1905). Encouraged in this by the villagers, who see a way of extending their authority, the lineage elders may appear to become headmen or chieftains of Mbuti bands, representing the band to the village chief."																															148	No	"The elder settles numerous disputes, both within and without his hunting band. Such disputes mainly concern marital disagreements, Schebesta says. The elders often settle controversies by delivering speeches during the evening, leading frequently to noisy debates between the elders of different bands or lineages. Outside the lineage context, the elder is not in any way different from the others; there are none of the trappings of villager chieftainship. He delivers his decisions without hesitancy and is obeyed in the same way within his lineage. His power is limited, however, by custom and tradition as well as by context. He may neither ignore nor alter traditional practices. 1Once again Schebesta’s account is confused, and confusing, because of his failure to define clearly the kinship constitution of the hunting band. As the bands are, in effect, usually cognatic, and as descent is of little significance, his assumption that the band is a patrilineage and that authority is based on lineage respect naturally led him into difficulty."																															149	No	"Costermans further agrees with Junker (1889-1891, vol. 3, 92) that many of the northern archers have recently themselves taken to a system of chieftainship. They lead their nomadic existence under the jurisdiction of a chief and in every way preserve their freedom under this jurisdiction. If there is any disagreement, however, they leave and place themselves under a neighboring chief. But not nearly enough information is given for any understanding of the structure of this “system.”"																															150	No	"Putnam goes further than Schebesta with regard to the existence or non-existence of chief-tainship among the Mbuti. Primarily of the net hunters he writes, “...there are no chiefs, councils, or any other formal governing bodies in a pygmy camp” (Putnam, 1948, 334). There is respect, he says, for age and experience ( not for “elders”); the opinions of the old and the wise are generally heeded. Any individual who shows disrespect for an old man, or who refuses to comply with any reasonable request, is abused by the others. Old men who are eccentrics are ignored.Additional information on this point comes from the notes of Anne Putnam, in which a loose form of council of five or six of the older men is reported. Each one of these is said by Mrs. Putnam to have some specific sphere of authority such as the regulation of hunting activities, settlement of interpersonal and other disputes, but further details are not given. No evidence is offered that they act in council rather than simply in their individual capacities. In the particular band to which Mrs. Putnam refers, however, five or six of the older men included the most experienced hunters in the whole band, so that only the aged and inform, the children, and the younger and less experienced hunters would not be members of the “council.” According to Putnam, the Mbuti respect experience as well as age, so that an individual's experience in a particular field increases his authority in that field. Thus the “council” [Page [p.228-c]] is almost certainly informal, because special authority within it is the result of individual qualities rather than of hereditary title to any particular office. Nowhere is there mention of any formal constitution of the council or hereditary tenure of office. Mrs. Putnam's information serves to confirm Putnam's assertion that there is no formal leadership, that any question that arises is settled by discussion, and that there is no single leader in such discussion, though respect is given to the older and more experienced men."																															151	No	"Masisi was a relative of Njobo's, and though not such a renowned [Page 33] hunter he was blessed with a large family. He had a powerful and penetrating voice, took an active part in any dispute, and usually managed to shout his opponents down, which is one of the chief ways the Pygmies have of settling a dispute. His family were all strikingly fine-looking, with almost Greek-like appearance although of normal Pygmy stature--under four and a half feet."																															152	No	"There were no chiefs, no formal councils. In each aspect of Pygmy life there might be one or two men or women who were more prominent than others, but usually for good practical reasons. This showed up most clearly of all in the settling of disputes. There was no judge, no jury, no court. The Negro tribes all around had their tribunals, but not the Pygmies. Each dispute was settled as it arose, according to its nature."																															153	No	"Issues other than disputes are settled the same way, without leadership appearing from any particular individual. If it is a matter involving the hunt, every adult male discusses it until there is agreement. [Page 125] The women can throw in their opinions, particularly if they know that the area the men have selected is barren of vegetable foods. But the men usually know this anyway."																															154	No	"On attempting to find this Mbuti Chief, I discovered that he was in fact just an elderly hunter, and that the girl was his granddaughter. The local Mbuti denied any system of chieftainship, but said that they always appointed one person to deal with the villagers, as in this instance. Both they and the villagers claimed that the legitimate heirs to the chieftainship had to be born of either one of these two formal unions, and that in fact the Chief would sleep again with one or the other girl until she bore him at least two boys. They also said that obviously he would not sleep again with his sister (he himself seemed somewhat disgusted at the recollection of his first night as Chief), and so it would be his Mbuti wife who would provide the tribe with its heir."																															155	No	"A superficial glimpse of the Mbuti/Villager relationship in any village might well tend to confirm the belief that the Mbuti are dependent upon the villagers for the very principles of their social organization. This is the claim of the villagers, the more sophisticated of which use a popular description of the Mbuti as “ les gens sans culture .” The Mbuti themselves will readily admit it, and investigation will, up to a point, confirm it. But we have already witnessed one contradiction; namely, that if the situation is one of superordination, and one of total cultural dependence of the Mbuti upon the villagers, then the villagers would have and be able to exercise some form of political control, and they do not. Indeed there are only the most tenuous political mechanisms for relating the two groups, such as the supposition that each hunting band has a headman or chief (entitled capita or sultani ) who is answerable to the village headman. The villagers accord the Mbuti headman due respect, not far different from the respect they would accord a junior headman of another village, and hold him responsible for the behavior of his band. But even supposing that the Mbuti headman had any actual authority over his band, we have seen that the villagers are incapable of enforcing their will by taking either retributive or restitutive action against the band or the capita for fear of reprisal, and because of their very real need for the continued, if minimal, service of the Mbuti and their fear of losing even that.The Mbuti capita in any case, is merely a village creation and carries no authority whatsoever and little influence among members of the hunting band. The other Mbuti accord him his title when in the village, or even when in the forest, if discussing a village problem. They use him as a convenient link who can also serve as a scapegoat. Through their “chief” the other Mbuti are freed of many of the cares and considerations involved in their relationship with the village, but [Page 45] the position is by no means always popular, and there are instances of dispute as to who should fill a vacant position as capita . Usually it is an Mbuti who has a highly developed taste for village foods, tobacco, wine and hemp. Most frequently he fills a dual role, also being the hunting band's clown, an important figure in the settling of internal disputes, again essentially a scapegoat. He will convey to the hunting band the wishes of the villagers, and discuss with the band the questions of food exchange or supply of labor. Among the net-hunters this is about as far as he will go, any decisions after that being taken by group discussion. Among the archers, however, the capita may go further, translating the villagers' demands into more practical terms, and suggesting how the band can best effect a compromise. He may even allocate specific tasks to specific individuals or families, but if he is heeded it is with notably bad grace, and again only because those concerned deem it expedient. The Mbuti headman has absolutely no authority in the band, even in its village context."																															156	No	"The hunters are generally in the middle of any dispute that occurs, but in a serious dispute it is more likely to be an elder that will be able to effect a settlement. It is, however, the disputes of the hunters that establish the lines along which fission and fusion will take place, and the elders have little influence over this process, nor do they even seem to wish to influence it. They content themselves by using the respect that is accorded them to maintain some kind of balance between the band factions. It is the hunters who initiate both fission and fusion, and who are thus responsible for the composition of the band. Relationships with neighboring bands and with the villagers, insofar as they are determined by band movement, are also largely in their hands, and in this sense the hunters may be considered the political leaders of the band. In this the women are almost, if not fully, the equals of the men."																															157	No	"Insofar as organization is in the nature of a response, then, leadership is minimal, in the economic realm. All major decisions are taken by common consent as in other realms of Mbuti life. Men and women have ecual say hunting and gathering being equally amportant to the economy. Young married couples and youths have the most to say, being the most active hunters and gatherers, but while ability as a hunter carries some weight, too much ability may lead to [Page 179] ridicule. That is, a man who displays himself as a great hunter, and boasts of his achievement too loudly, is somewhat distrusted, and any attempt on his part to use his reputation to gain more say than others will lead immediately to ridicule."																															158	No	"It is only in the village, then, that the nuclear family can really be considered as a separate economic identity (this is particularly true of the net-hunters, rather less so for the arehers). In the realm of forest subsistence the individual and the family are subordinated to the band or, perhaps better, become immersed in the band, for they almost lose their identity. Family membership is of no consequence in determining economic responsibility, age and territoriality are the more important factors. Any tendency toward charismatic leadership is countered by ridicule, and any persistence on the part of the hunter may lead to his being given the job of representing the [Page 180] band to the village as its capita or sultani . ...."																															159	No	"Before attempting to understand the over-all system of government in Mbuti society, it is necessary to distinguish between different fields of authority, for each field of activity has its own leaders, drawn from a particular segment of the community. It is in this way that authority is dispersed throughout the band; every adult is accorded special respect in one field or another, but none can claim respect in all fields. Individual authority is unthinkable, and not only are there no chiefs or headmen in Mbuti society; there are not even any councils of elders or any ritual specialists such as prophets or diviners. Such adults as have respect in any particular field at any particular moment do not even have any authority; they can merely claim to be heard. Their decision is likely to be given general assent and, as in economic matters, that decision is then said to be “good,” and “pleasing” to the forest. The forest personified as a benevolent divinity remains as the only recognized authority, one which sometimes expresses its feelings with unmistakable clarity; an excessive storm, falling trees, poor hunting and ill health may all be taken as signs of displeasure, while good weather and good health and good hunting are indications that all is well. But often the forest remains silent. Then the Mbuti have to sound its feelings out through discussion. Dreams may be taken into account, but there is no question of waiting for visible signs of the forest's pleasure. The delegation of authority is clear; the decision of the whole band, the very fact of unanimity, is sufficient sign of the favor of the forest. There is always diversity of opinion, freely expressed, but prolonged disagreement is considered as “noise,” and offensive to the forest. Unanimity, therefore, is a powerful and positive value, equated with the opposite to noisequiet, or ekimi ."																															160	No	"There are many examples of Mbuti who have appeared in the role of leader vis-a-vis the village, but as their authority was nil in relation to forest life, they need not concern us here. Their only function in the forest, other than their normal role as hunters, was to communicate the wishes of the one group of people to the other."																															161	No	"Of the two, Ekianga probably had the more influence in the band, and his unique position as a polygamist was undoubtedly related to both his prowess and his pride. There is, however, no parallel with the situation acutely described by Lévi-Strauss (1955, pp. 325-39) for the Nambikwara. Ekianga was indeed a potential leader, but the band did not derive its major characteristics from him. Still less was generosity demanded of him (in return for his three wives), and by no means was his undoubted dynamism contrasted by a passivity of the rest of the band. Nonetheless, his three wives and all the consequent “noise” were accepted by the band, and although it was not spoken of as an exchange, it was expected of Ekianga that he would be a [Page 184] particular asset in the hunt. This was his world. He had little or no interest in the village."																															162	No	"Njobo's father, Biyonga, had not been outstanding in any way. He had been dead a number of years, and nobody seemed to remember him for any particular qualities. 1Although there was a general reluctance to mention the dead by name, or even to talk about them, there was no rigid prohibition. It was a question more of there being no particular occasion for such mention. If Biyonga had been exceptional in any way, it would certainly have arisen sooner or later in ordinary conversation, and equally certainly in response to questioning.Njobo, on the other hand, was among the finest hunters, and unique in having killed, single-handed, four elephants. He had also participated in successful communal elephant and buffalo hunts, and apart from being a hunter of the utmost courage, he was also a man of the utmost integrity. He possessed, in abundance, all those qualities the Mbuti admire most except a good singing voice. He himself was modest, and usually self-effacing in the hunting camp. He came to the fore in relations with the village, and frequently acted as “headman” of the band in that respect. However, if ever he spoke too loudly in camp, he was either shouted down or laughed at; ridicule he accepted and even welcomed. I only heard him make a retort once, when reference was made to his son's inability to walk without a stick. He said, “It is never good for one man to talk too much, particularly if he is right. But if an Mbuti has something to say, what else can he do?”"																															163	No	"It is plain, then, that while any movement toward individual authority, conscious or otherwise, is sharply countered, and while individual authority is virtually nil, there is nonetheless a clear basic framework to support the values of the hunting band. There is the division of leadership, according to field, throughout the entire band, yet there is the midcamp site from which anyone may harangue all present. Although he has no means of compelling attention, it is generally accorded, and may be further compelled by pointing to or naming the individuals concerned. Further it is plain that the elders, including those hunters whose position is being gradually taken over by their children act as final arbitrators, always careful to stress that what they say is a matter of their opinion, or of their heart. Only when unanimity is beyond question is an opinion or an action considered [Page 188] “pleasing to the forest.” Asuku had placed himself, physically and morally, beyond the forest."																															164	No	"There is consequently no central leadership, in the form of an individual or even of a council, with which the centralized village leadership can deal in political terms. Nor is there any lineal leadership, let alone any stable lineal unit, with which village lineal units can relate, except in theory. The institution of karé brotherhood is primarily an individual relationship, and although its abuse can enlarge the relationship to a band/village level, there is again no mechanism of effective relationship at that level, Therefore the karé relationship, insofar as it is effective, only relates individuals."																															165	No	"Political influence, usually derived directly or indirectly from political office, makes it easier for a man to obtain rist land through pedigrees that have been unused for many generations or that is distant from his homestead. To put it another way, political influence enables him to extend the genealogical and geographical range of his ability to obtain rist land through his rist rights. There are several reasons for this. A powerful person can litigate more successfully than an ordinary farmer because of his ability to mobilize favorable witnesses, influence the judge, and sustain the cost, in time and money, of a protracted court case. In some instances landholding members of a descent group are willing or even eager to recognize an influential man’s claim because they think he will prove to be a powerful ally in their struggle against a rapacious local leader or a rival segment of the group. Finally, an influential man can find tenants to sharecrop his distant fields—tenants who are also, in a sense, clients and who regard him as a patron as well as a landlord."																															166	No	"It would be a mistake, however, to exaggerate the role of genealogical information in the politics of Amhara land tenure and to suggest that knowledge is power. Many men with genealogical expertise are without political influence because they lack the other attributes of leadership, and many men with influence have attained the office of fej, though their knowledge of the ancestors is limited. In the last analysis, particularly in major land disputes involving claims through division by father, it is not so much that knowledge of the genealogical charter is power, as it is that power enables those who wield it to enunciate an authoritative version of the charter."																															167	No	"Tenancy arrangements between an ordinary man and a man of power and authority may have a “political” as well as an economic dimension. The tenant may become the landlord’s “follower,” visiting him often with small gifts of liquor, beer, or livestock, escorting him on journeys, and attending church festivals in his retinue. In this, as in any patron-client tie in Dega Damot, the landlord gains honor and support while the tenant expects help in court, or protection and an occasional gift. The share of the crop paid to the landlord is sometimes less than the customary amount when the “political” aspect of the relationship is paramount. This is particularly true when the field held by the tenant is at a great distance from the landlord’s residential parish. In yet another arrangement, a great man may give land rent-free to artisans in return for their skilled labor."																															168	No	"The relative importance to an individual of these various ways of acquiring land depends on his position in the domestic [Page 145] cycle, his standing in his local community, and his status in the wider sphere of regional politics. A young married man usually obtains most of his land through inheritance or through gift in anticipation of inheritance. The social setting in which such land transfers occur is largely defined by the norms, interests, and sentiments of household and kinship relations. Somewhat older men whose fathers are dead or who live in a different community from their fathers try to obtain additional fields from the representatives of descent corporations by pressing claims for land through division by allotment. Such claims are formally argued in terms of descent rules, but their success or failure is strongly influenced by interests relating to community organization and leadership. Finally, those elders and officeholders who attain prominence in the wider political community of Dega Damot try to claim additional land by demanding a further division of land by father; that is, by “bringing in a new minzir abbat.” Such claims are formally argued in terms of descent corporation ideology and rules, but their success depends heavily on the plaintiff’s ability to mobilize support for his cause through his personal political ties."																															169	No	"The notion of what constitutes holding too much land is related to prestige and is even more difficult to define than the notion of need. Inasmuch as social status in the community is in part a product of the amount of land held, the concept of having too much land for one’s status is somewhat circular. There are, however, other important factors which affect a man’s status and concomitant estimates of the amount of land he should enjoy. Paramount among these are the frequency with which a man is asked to arbitrate the disputes of his fellows and is appointed to unofficial or official posts of parish and neighborhood administration. It is generally accepted as appropriate or at least inevitable that such a man, a leader in his community, should hold more land in local descent corporations’ estates than lesser men hold."																															170	No	"Two of the men asked to give up fields were former titled officeholders, long retired from official service and with the dwindling households that usually accompany old age. Another was the son of a titled former officeholder who once held extensive lands in the area. A fourth designee was the full brother of the a[unknown]tb[unknown]iya dañña of Feres Bét, the parish in which the land of Shoa Hayl is located. A fifth was the elder full brother of one of the claimants. Three more were elderly men who had demonstrated little acumen at amassing land or attaining leadership, and the remaining two were young men who had inherited an unusual amount of land but had not yet achieved the standing in the community that would enable them to easily defend their rights in it."																															171	No	"The political influence through which some elders are able to claim more rist land than their fellow farmers is diffuse, localized and personal. In large part, it is usually based on the respect they have won over the years as arbitrators, counselors, and go-betweens in local community affairs. Particularly in the case of a debtera political influence may also be enhanced by an element of fear. An elder may also obtain influence by becoming a personal follower of a more powerful man such as a local gwilt ge[unknown]z ."																															172	No	"The most important source of the secular power which has enabled men to obtain large holdings of rist land has been political office, particularly the office of the local gwilt-holder, or gwilt ge[unknown]z . Traditionally, the power of the gwilt ge[unknown]z was pervasive and immediate since he served at once as judge, principal tax collector, and government representative. Even today, backed by the authority of the government from above and supported by his personal followers, the gwilt ge[unknown]z is able to exert considerable influence over the people resident within his neighborhood. This influence rests not only on the clearly prescribed duties of his office but also on his ability to help or harm his subjects when he carries out his duties."																															173	No	"To these powerful and landed men of Dega Damot, the quest for land, with its constant involvement in dispute and intrigue, has been as much a political as an economic activity; and the land itself has been as much a form of political as economic capital. In order to attract retainers to his court and cause, a great officeholder had to be able to feast them at his table, to reward them periodically with clothes, and eventually, if he were a great man and they served him well, to help them obtain control over land, particularly gwilt, with which, in turn, they could hope to build a following of their own. Without such a cadre of loyal followers attracted by land and the fruits of the land, a great officeholder could not enforce his rule over those who were nominally under his jurisdiction, protect his interests against his peers who were inevitably rivals, and provide the support expected of him by his superior lord; for it was characteristic of the traditional Amhara polity that a man’s political power derived more from his ability to help or harm individuals under his control than from his occupancy of a clearly defined position of command in an enduring political organization."																															174	No	"The other way that the rist system and polity have interpenetrated one another in processual terms has been that strategic decisions men make as members of one system are greatly affected by their position and their interests in the other. Most important, by seeking rist land and leadership positions in an increasing number of descent corporations, men have been able to convert newly acquired political power into a personal estate of “hereditary” land commensurate with their new status. The rist system also facilitated downward social mobility. In the absence of a politically successful heir, 7. Virtually no office and no title was hereditary in a strict sense in traditional Amhara society.the rist land amassed by a powerful individual was soon broken up by the inheritance rule that gave land, at least in theory, equally to all children. Often the dissolution of a powerful man’s holding after his death was accelerated by the inability of his heirs to hold together and utilize his widely scattered lands. The net result of these processes was [Page 243] a rather fluid relationship between land, power, and honor in Amhara society."																															175	No	"Quasi-military titles have reference to positions of leadership in the traditional armies of the emperor and the great regional rulers. They are not, however, military offices, and the men who hold them do not necessarily have any military responsibilities"																															176	No	"The relationship between the clients of a patron is characterized by mistrust, suspicion, and malicious rivalry. Their ability to cooperate, to [Page 196] the extent that they do, rests on the constant efforts of their patron to restrain them from quarreling rather than from a sense of purposive solidarity in his behalf. Indeed, a patron spends a good deal of his time managing relationships between his followers, usually through secretive audiences first with one and then with another. 4"																															177	No	"Power in the Amhara polity is intensive. A man of high rank has virtually no power over people unless they have bonds of personal dependency on him or his followers, and his control over his followers’ followers is tenuous. Indeed, a man has no political relationship, per se, with other men unless they are his immediate superior, his follower, or are bound as client to the same lord. 6. This generalization, like most generalizations, is not completely accurate. Powerful emperors did attempt to establish a rudimentary administration—particularly for purposes of tax collection—in areas over which they had a high degree of control. Such attempts were only temporary successes and seldom outlived the reign of the ruler."																															178	No	"There were many distinctions of rank within the rist -holding class. These were evident in the seating arrangements at the feasts which accompanied weddings, memorial services for the dead, and major holidays. Guests were seated strictly in accordance with their honor on all of these occasions regardless of their roles (other than guest) in the proceedings. The main factor contributing to honor once again was the control derived from land, followers, and perhaps a close service tie with the local lord. Amhara often describe the important men of their community as big men ( tilliq saw ) or wealthy man. The latter appellation is misleading since it is only the wealth that comes from controlling land that gives honor. Even today a rich merchant is accorded little honor. Finally, all other factors being equal, age was an important criterion in the local community ranking pattern."																															179	No	"The mekwannint constituted the structure around which military activity in Amhara society coalesced and through which it was sustained. It is in keeping with this martial orientation that the most prized Amhara titles were in origin and reference positions of leadership in the army. The more important of these were:Positions mentioned at other times include chief of honey-mead making, chief of beer-brewing, chief of bread-baking, chief of the lord’s horses, chief of the lord’s cattle, and even chief chaser-away-of-hyenas from the imperial tent! The specificity of the tasks referred to in these titles is misleading. What was required of the incumbent was that he command and control the people who performed the job, not that he have any particular technical competence. In all instances, these job-descriptive titles stressed the personal service performed for the lord within his household-military camp. The men who held these titles were not the heads of differentiated, functionally specific hierarchies through which the lord administered his domain. When there was a job to be supervised at some distance from the lord’s camp, any of the high officials might be [Page 208] assigned the task of overseeing it to completion. In battle, the essentially unspecialized nature of the court officials became abundantly evident, for, one and all, the members of the lord’s camp, from cook to brewmaster to majordomo and general, were warriors."																															180	No	"When the lord traveled, he always rode on a finely caparisoned mule. Around him were as many gun-bearing followers as befitted his means and station. If he was of high rank he was accompanied by a prescribed number of mounted kettledrums (Anhr.: negarit, literally, announcers) which announced his glorious approach. Ordinary travelers had to dismount, if they were riding, rearrange their white cotton shawls in one of the deferential styles, and bow to the great man as he approached. If a lord was passing through his own territory, peasants would leave their [Page 209] plows in midfield and accompany his procession as far as the parish boundary or even father."																															181	No	"Such men fared best in troubled times, such as the first half of the nineteenth century, the “age of princes,” when any able brigand leader might hope to have his power “clothed with authority.” Indeed the Emperor Theodore, who put an end to this unhappy period of Ethiopian political turmoil, was himself such a self-made man."																															182	No	"Throughout the greater part of the period of Amhara ascendancy the seat of the imperial court was a mobile military camp. At the center of this circular city of tents were the emperor’s personal tents and the tent that housed his chapel. Arranged in a fixed pattern around the royal tents were the tent establishments of those of the emperor’s great retainers who were at court, each surrounded in turn by his followers and would-be followers. On the outer circumference of the camp was a horde of ragged followers.The ruler had several means by which he could attempt to enforce his rights. Important among these were the small army he maintained personally, his ability to monopolize a high proportion of firearms in the land (after their introduction in the sixteenth century), and his ability to appoint and recall, promote and demote his major followers. The ability of the emperor to exercise this last prerogative was the best index to the extent of his actual power."																															183	No	"The representative of a major sub-house usually retains his office for life unless he leaves Dega Damot or an unusual conflict requires new leadership (see Case 4, below). At his death he is not usually replaced until his group is involved in a dispute. One of his sons who is using the land of the house may act in his stead and may eventually be elected to the office. There is no predilection for filial succession, but it is thought likely that the son, having had ample opportunity to observe his father at work, will have acquired some of his ability and requisite knowledge of the genealogical charter.Every active, corporate sub-house, even below the minor sub-house level, can have a representative 16 . If the sub-house is relatively unimportant, its representativeship remains an ephemeral office. The more interests a sub-house has, the more concrete becomes the office of its representative."																															184	No	"Tägä[unknown]n[unknown]nä is [unknown]c[unknown]qa[unknown] sum every four years, taking turns with the other more respected elders of the parish.

He has managed to balance his ambitions with the egalitarian jealousies of his relatives and neighbors in such a way as to keep their respect while acquiring much r[unknown]st . This is a difficult task since the very manipulations he must perform to increase his holdings may anger his fellows and reduce his chance of being appointed to positions of local leadership that are necesary to his success.

He is soft-spoken and careful, yet eloquent when the occasion demands."																															185	No	"At the age of 22, with fifteen years of grueling study behind him, Ayyälä set off for Addis Ababa to see the only bishop in all Ethiopia. He carried with him letters of introduction from both church and civil authorities in Dega Damot. His letters, hours of patient waiting near the doors [Page 180] of important officials, luck, and his considerable erudition brought him to success. At the age of 23, Ayyälä was appointed to be administrative head and judge of all the secular clergy( Liqäkah[unknown]nat ) in Aräfa subdivision of Dega Damot. The office was not without its rewards in the form of presents, power, and honor. After holding the office for eleven years, Ayyälä was able to have himself appointed to the powerful office of chief clerk of Dega Damot. In a country where full literacy is rare, the position of chief clerk has an almost ritual significance. In many ways it might be more accurately described as deputy governor. In addition to receiving many gifts, Ayyälä received two parishes as r[unknown]stägult . One of them is Däräqe Maryam from which most of the examples in this work have been drawn.Ayyälä’s tenants, even those who do not live in his gults , are also his followers. They come to see him often, wait for hours at his door, bring him presents, bow to the ground when they chance to meet him, arranging their flowing shawl ( [unknown]sämma ) in the most respectful way, and kissing his feet unless he raises them up to kiss his chest or shoulders."																															186	No	"Ayyälä expects to see his tenant-followers quite often. If they stay away for more than a reasonable period of time, he will suspect that they are plotting against him or currying the favor of some other important man."																															187	No	"Ayyälä has obligations to his followers, among which the most important are plying them with food and drink when they visit him and protecting their interests against the machinations of other important men."																															188	No	"The peasant’s relations with this political hierarchy have been mediated by the office of ch[unknown]iqa shum, a district headman.

The emperors rewarded nobles who served them with grants of land. The higher chieftains in turn rewarded their own followers accordingly. These estates were usually held in absentia, the peasants [Page 161] who cultivated them being required to hand over a certain proportion of their produce every year. *Each land unit worked by a given tenant farmer, or gabbar, would be divided according to that proportion, in order to equalize the differences resulting from variation in such factors as the size of land units or the quality of soil. The proportion paid to the landlord varied with the location of the land; thus, one-half might be exacted for ordinary dega (high) land, while in certain qola (low) areas only a tenth might be required, owing to the difficulties of heat, jungle, and wild beasts."																															190	No	"The opportunities, both psychic and economic, were impressive. One was expected to avail himself of all the obsequious gestures which serve to swell the ego of an Abyssinian ruler. If so inclined, the governor could indulge his sadism ad libitum; sword, lash, and rope were, besides the nagarit and seal, the official insignia of a provincial ruler. He could order the peasants in his area to labor for him—to plow his lands or build his houses—as well as command them to military service. He could exact tribute from them without relief, in addition to appropriating for his family and retainers part of the [Page 162] taxes collected in the name of the emperor. Concerning the imposts for which the peasants were liable, Plowden wrote in 1844:They pay a certain portion in kind to the Ras, or other great chief, and sometimes a regular tax in money; besides this, they must furnish oxen to plough the king’s lands. Their immediate governor then takes his share in kind of every grain (say a fifth), and feeds besides a certain number of soldiers at the expense of each householder: he has rights to oxen, sheep, goats, butter, honey, and every other requisite for subsistence; he must be received with joy and feasting by his subjects whenever he visits them, and can demand from them contributions on fifty pretexts—he is going on a campaign, or has just returned from one; he has lost a horse, or married a wife; his property has been consumed by fire, or he has lost his all in battle; or the sacred duty of a funeral banquet cannot be fulfilled without their aid. 147"																															191	No	"High secular status in Abyssinia was dependent on a complex of possessions—land, political strength, and honorific titles—which tended to reinforce one another. The possession of much land has always been a basis for considerable deference in Abyssinia. As a source of produce, rents, and revenues deflected from the Crown, moreover, it was also a source of wealth to be used in building up one’s political strength by rewarding able soldiers and loyal followers, and by making gifts to one’s superiors. Political power was directly obtained through the acquisition of governorships. Such offices were a further basis for much deference and, through the incumbent’s access to tribute, customs fees, court fees, and gifts from his subjects, of much income as well. Titles, finally, not only were universally esteemed but also entitled the bearers to a style of life which included a presumptive right to gifts and obedience from all inferiors as well as the consumption of much wealth and power."																															192	No	"Neither principle was ever realized in pure form. No matter how great his [Page 166] authority, the emperor could never afford to ignore the hereditary claims of regional bal[unknown]abb[unknown]at in dispensing favors and making appointments. He needed a minimum of support from regional lords who commanded devoted followers, and he could not with impunity alienate any number of these at a given time. In practice, imperial favor was accorded both on the basis of personal loyalty and military ability, and of ascriptive claims to rank based on birth. The exercise of imperial authority was often a question simply of confirming the leadership of a locally successful bal[unknown]abb[unknown]at ."																															193	No	"With regard to regionally based strength, on the other hand, birth was not a sufficient factor to assure a man a high position. (It was not even necessary, strictly speaking. Any man could attempt to build up a position of power by attracting followers. He had a much better chance, however—a chance to attain authority, and not merely force—if he came from a noted family.) If, as the son of an important lord, he inherited his father’s position, he had to prove himself a suitable leader or risk being deposed by the men of the area. At the very least he had to withstand competition from his brothers. Thus, as we saw in the history of Manz, two of Nagassi’s sons were deposed before the men of Manz found in Sebste a leader worthy of his father’s mantle. Military ability, political shrewdness, and lavish generosity toward one’s followers were the decisive characteristics which, together with strong ambition, could enable the son of a bal[unknown]abb[unknown]at to attract followers and make claims of his own. With adequate forces, he could even depose a regional governor and take his place, so long as he took possession of the official drum ( nagarit ) of the office. 155. Plowden, op. cit., p. 46.Go to end note pageFor complete legitimation, however, it was usually necessary to secure confirmation of the rule of a locally successful bal[unknown]abb[unknown]at by the emperor. This was the reason why Nagassi is said to have journeyed to Gondar."																															194	No	"Menelik revived Tewodros’ policy of creating a band of generals loyal only to himself. He did this partly by raising capable men with no connections to high position: Ras Gob[unknown]an[unknown]a and Fit[unknown]awr[unknown]ari Habta Giyorgis, two of his most important generals, were originally Galla prisoners. The power of the feudal chieftains he manipulated by traditional techniques, sending them to posts far removed from their home bases, and arranging political marriages. But Menelik did not decisively undercut the authority of the great provincial lords, and at his death the old political structure was still more or less intact."																															195	No	"The preoccupation with orality which appears in their traditional orientations has not disappeared among those Abyssinians who have acquired a modern education. In some respects, that experience has tended to intensify it. A state of prolonged dependence was institutionalized in the government school system. The hiring of most educated Ethiopians by the government has meant that most of them live in a position of waiting to receive their salary—or [unknown]injara, as they themselves put it—from the central authority. Thus the image of a bountiful father-figure has become the more firmly established. While in his own person the Emperor has projected an image of vigorous leadership, he has at the same time taken pains to promote this old pattern of oral dependence, by sending gifts of food to students and of champagne to educated officials when they marry; by continuing to provide politically relevant feasts at the palace; and, like the traditional Amhara father-feeder, by frequently reminding his subjects that everything they have they owe to him. This pattern is replicated to some extent in the relations between members of the new nobility and their younger relatives and retainers."																															196	No	"The independent status of the common soldier in mass levies was based on the fact that he was primarily a peasant and thus expected to return to his fields as soon as a particular campaign was over. Nor were members of the more permanent armies of lords greatly constrained. Loyalty to one’s lord was in many cases a lasting tie, and accounts for much of the stability that existed in such arrangements. But in general it appears to have been a factor of far less moment than was the case, for example, in feudal Japan. The Amhara soldier felt he was fighting for a lord by his own free will and, therefore, had every right to leave him when conditions justified a move. One such condition was when the lord did not reward his followers liberally enough. Another related condition was when the lord had a tendency to suffer defeat in battle. Indeed, it was not uncommon for soldiers to swarm from one side to the other during a battle when defeat for their side seemed imminent. Still another basis for deserting one’s chief was the ambition of a vassal to acquire greater power, in which case he might rebel—become a sh[unknown]ifta, in the original sense of the word—and build up a military force of his own in the hope either of impressing his erstwhile master sufficiently to be reinstated with greater honors, or of taking his place by vanquishing him in combat, or simply of carrying on as a free agent."																															197	No	"Thus, viewed as a whole, Amhara society does not envelop the individual in a complex network of obligations and constraints. The institutional structure of the society is relatively thin. There are few collectivities to which the individual might belong, and fewer still to which he must belong. He can, if he chooses, live at the very periphery of society—as a hermit, a monk, a sh[unknown]ifta, a minstrel, a beggar, or, if a woman, as a solitary householder. For the typical Amhara, the main obligations are to fulfil work responsibilities in behalf of the nuclear family, the parents, and to provide income and services for landlords and chieftains. Here, too, there are important degrees of freedom. An oppressive family situation may be readily relieved by divorce; an oppressive landlord or ruler may possibly be brought to justice over time, or in extreme instances fled from; and for the oppressed vassal or retainer, there is always the alternative of running away to another master or of turning to one’s own devices. As a Christian, the Amhara is required to fast a good deal; but attendance at church and membership in religious fraternal associations are voluntary, and for the religious scholar there is considerable freedom of movement."																															198	No	"In theory, the emperor was the ultimate head of the entire Ethiopian state, head of the army, the church, and disposer of all lands and offices. In actuality, both the power of hereditary feudal lords and the difficulty of travel restricted his authority until the advent of modern communications and air travel in this century. While it was in the best interests of the emperor to appoint as many loyal provincial governors as he could, certain hereditary nobles held traditional control of areas which the emperor, unless he wanted to go to war, had little likelihood of reclaiming. Below the provincial governors were the village chiefs (CHEQA SUM), who also, in theory, represented and were appointed by the emperor. In most cases, however, they were the hereditary leading men of the village. Governors more often had a say in making a choice between contenders, and the emperor's role in most situations was only to settle a dispute or make an appointment official. A CHEQA SUM acted as a judge, presided over meetings of the village council, attended weddings, and was involved in all land transfers and disputes. He is the lowest representative of the emperor and was responsible for communicating all decrees of the central government to his village."																															199	No	"This has long been a basic Amhara attitude, even a world view for them. The Amhara has seen much justification for associating skill of hand with slavery and near-slave status, while associating mental and spiritual skills with leadership: as military officer, judge, bishop, or zar doctor."																															200	No	"Until the diminution of feudal privileges during recent decades, the chiqa shum was also responsible for providing the military-feudal chiefs and their troops with provisions when they were on march, making it unnecessary for them to depend on supply lines. Now that army troops receive regular salaries, he still has to play host to travelling officials for their personal needs, since there are no rural hotels. They do not pay him except by promises of future favors"																															201	No	"The pattern in the former feudal military service was one of greater pride and prestige, even for the poorest Amhara. The feudal-military chief had to clothe, house and feed his men, and could never use them for hard labor, such as agriculture - especially plowing - even when he had no temporary work for them. They were quartered with peasants whom they exploited like serfs, and since the chief paid no wages, he assigned his soldiers gult land, often on a temporary basis, which included the peasants who usually were non-Orthodox and did not have the protection of either church or chiqa shum."																															202	No	"For example, the ras himself would have to make frequent personal inspection tours of storehouses and major activities, if he wanted to avoid disorganization. In his presence, his men would fall all over themselves, running to carry out his orders instantly, to curry his favor. In his absence, his officers and men would relax after the fashion of free men, to their way of thinking. A chief, asked about the number of men under his command, would reply “many”, not so much for reasons of concealment and pride (i.e. “the number of my men is without end”), but because he often did not know, nor care. However he knew exactly how many rifles he had in his command (Griaule 1931:5)."																															203	No	"The location in camp of military officers and men thus indicated the social position of feudal nobles, soldier fief-holders, and gebbar-sharecroppers in civilian life. The rank-order can be listed, with some simplification, in Table 3. It is noteworthy that the military ranking of the commoner-soldiery, which made up the rank and file of the fighters on foot, was not nearly so formal. The fortunes of war, if they did not leave him dead or maimed, could move him upward to lower nobility. Failing to achieve that, veterans could still hope for a modest fief of gult land, enabling him to play the tilliq sew (great man) role over some hapless gebbar peasants. Meanwhile, pseudo-big men behaved much like the proverbial sergeant of any army, making his men fear him more than any enemy, rewarding them with feasts, in this case of raw beef and medium-alcoholic mead. The only way he could maintain his following of individual-minded Amhara soldiers, each one of whom wanted to be a hero himself, was by continuous personal bravery, coupled with cleverness in military tactics. But here the similarity ends, for the non-noble chief of Amhara warriors had no pride of a non-commissioned officer; his ambition was to become a real tilliq sew, a minor nobleman owning rist lands."																															204	No	"A male zar doctor had, in the recent past, a place of honor at the table of feudal chiefs, who often consulted them - perhaps more because of the doctors’ knowledge of humans and public opinion than because of their supposed spirit world. Even today (1955), the social status and income of a zar doctor in rural areas and provincial towns is [Page 303] high, and he can afford such expensive European attire and apparel as a folding umbrella, laced shoes, a ring of silver or gold, etc. He may break rules of politeness, even utter mild insults and commit familiarities without repression and penalty, for no layman can know whether or not it is the spirit who speaks through the doctor in any given situation."																															205	No	"It will also be noted that there are very few duties which might be called executive. The laigwanan does not enforce judgments, or visit bomas collecting cattle for the laibon -- the matters are discussed in open baraza and the weight of public opinion compels the individual to act as required. When this fails there is nothing to take its place. This explains why the laigwanak often make unsatisfactory paid headmen. Frequently the action required of a headman has not got this necessary weight of public opinion behind it, and consequently there is no indigenous method of enforcing an order."																															206	No	"The Moran had special privileges, such as that of cohabitation with unmarried girls, and were relieved of all tribal obligation save fighting and raiding. Even such forms of manual labour as were involved in a pastoral life were avoided by them. They remained on the fighting strength of the tribe or periods which originally varied from seven to twelve years, and then, after the celebration of the E-unoto ceremony, “drank milk” and passed into the stage of Elders. But, as Sir Charles Eliot observed in 1905, “the Elders' ideal of existence seemed to be case, not unmixed with drunkenness.” 1 Those who attained a position of wealth and importance might be elected as Chiefs, but the functions of a Chief were restricted to leadership in raiding or warfare."																															207	No	"To quote Sir Charles Eliot again, the consequence of the traditional structure of Masai society was that “the centre of political gravity was not with the elders or chiefs, but with a republic of young men, governed by ideas of military comradeship. The chiefs arranged the details of any raids which the young men wished to undertake, but their power of compelling them to do anything which they did not wish was very slight.” The nearest approach to a central and superior authority was to be found in the Chief Medicine-Man (Laibon), though his authority was based mainly on the discharge of his magical functions. 1The word laibon appears to be a Europeanized form of the Masai word Ol'oiboni (A. C. Hollis, The Nandi, 1909, page 49.The medicine-men were divided into three grades, of which the first grade was represented by the person of the Laibon, the Chief Medicine-Man of the tribe, and his guidance was held to be of the first importance in any major operation which the tribe might undertake."																															208	No	"In the period that has passed since this system was introduced, there have been changes which have to some measure affected the structure of Masai society. The restraint exercised on cattle raiding has robbed the military organization of its former importance, while the growing value of cattle and sheep has enhanced the position of the wealthier stockholders, who now constitute, together with some men of hereditary prestige, an aristocratic element with an acknowledged leadership in Masai society. In other respects the Masai hold tenaciously to their customary institutions and mode of life, and the Moran in particular retain the tradition of indiscipline (in all but a military sense) and the aversion to labour which characterized them in the past."																															209	No	"This military organization of the Masai made them a most effective body for destructive military operations, and explains not only the predominant position which they acquired in East Africa, but also the respect which they inspired and the extent to which their customs were imitated by other tribes. On the other hand, it probably also is the reason why they never founded any state or polity analogous to the kingdoms of Uganda and Unyoro. The centre of political gravity was not with the elders or chiefs, but with a republic of young men, governed by ideas of military comradeship and desirous only of military glory. Retirement from this band of warriors as a chief was honourable, but seems to have been recognized as a removal to an inferior sphere of activity. The chiefs arranged the details of the raids which the warriors wished to undertake, but their power of compelling them to do anything which they did not wish was very slight."																															210	No	"A leading role among the warriors is played, furthermore, by the el oi[unknown] nok 1 (= the bulls), of whom there are five or six in every kraal and who gain their position by courage and bravery in war, as well as by superior physical strength. They are the leaders in battle. As a sign of their rank they wear, in dancing and in hand-to-hand [Page 115] 87 cont. fighting, large leg bells ( el duallan kitwa ), the tinkling of which in the latter instance serves to prevent a going astray by the individual warriors and a scattering of the troops. Where the bell sounds is a rallying point."																															211	No	"Speaker and leader live like other warriors and are not surrounded by any special ceremonial. Off duty they are treated with respect, which is shown especially by the fact that people avoid coming too close to their girls or lightly seizing an excuse for a quarrel with them. Among the other warriors these two things almost daily lead to serious disputes and often enough to dueling, in which the opponents go after each other with sword and club, but only very rarely wound each other seriously. If this should happen sometime, in a few districts the wounded one receives from the victor a fine consisting of livestock; in other districts, only if a bone is broken. In general immediately after the duel 88 sometimes only after the healing of the wound, reconciliation follows, the formality of which consists of the mutual exchange of sandal thongs and sometimes also the exchange of the skin cape ( e megiti ). The matter becomes more serious if one is killed in a duel. First the father of the victor is then condemned to pay a larger number of cattle. If he hands them over, the affair is settled. If he refuses them, however, the friends of the man killed attack his kraal and rob him of his entire herd. But they have scarcely brought them home before the friends of the one robbed also try to rescue them again. This goes on until they have become tired [Page 116] 88 cont. of the fight, or until one party remains the victor two or more times in succession. The fight assumes greater dimensions if the two duelists belonged to different lineages or even different tribes. ThenIll. 32. Dance in the warrior kraal I.the two lineages or the two tribes make war on each other insofar as they live in one district; a conflict that is equivalent to a small civil war arises. Members of these lineages or tribes who live in a more distant district do not take part in the fight."																															212	No	"The spears are stuck in the ground in a semicircle about five paces in diameter, and against them, on the outside, the shields are placed in such a way that one overlaps the other like scales. The warriors lie or squat in this semicircle, armed with their weapons, awaiting [Page 125] 95 cont.Ill. 37. Section camp on the war march.the time for the attack. 96 The leader of the section is one of the above-mentioned benefactors, recognizable by an ornament called el dorog[unknown] en or el gabat[unknown] en , which consists of strings of iron or glass beads and is worn around the right lower-arm, a gift of those who have benefited by his generosity."																															214	No	"Among his instructions, the most closely guarded secret that overshadows this particular consultation is the choice of moran to fill two highly respected but unpopular roles: the man-who-is-planted-upright ( olotuno ) as their ritual leader, and the man-of-the-cut-thong ( oloboruen-keene ) as his deputy. There is a belief that the destiny of the ritual leader is inversely linked to that of his age-group. They are expected to prosper while he will be dogged by misfortune-it could be poverty, childlessness or even an early death. This belief is more strongly developed among the southern Maasai than in the north; and in Matapato, which is regarded as closer to the south, opinion is divided. Some point sceptically to the success and long life of certain ritual leaders recently. Others suggest that this is simply because the misfortune has bedevilled the whole age-group instead. Others insist that the deputy ritual leaders are also at risk. One young elder of Meruturud R enthusiastically described signs of premature senility in his own ritual leader, regarding this as an omen that his age-group would remain mentally agile as old men. Even sceptics admitted that the 1977 eunoto was overshadowed by the knowledge that the ritual leader of Nyankusi R had died prematurely at their olngesher festival, which is a sequel to eunoto . Misfortune in Matapato eyes has the habit of history repeating itself. The period when the Nyankusi R had been moran had been disastrous for their herds, and now this had again occurred while their firestick wards of the Ngorisho R were moran. It therefore seemed plausible to expect that the Ngorisho R ritual leader would die early, like his predecessor. In health, wealth, offspring, and life itself, both ritual leader and his deputy are thought to be at risk, and differences of opinion concern the level of that risk rather than the general premise.Before asking the Prophet to determine the choice of ritual leader and his deputy, a shortlist is prepared by the patrons and moran spokesmen. The ideal candidate should be unflappable, unblemished and with a pure Maasai ancestry. The Prophet is expected to question them closely on these aspects before secretly consulting his oracle. His choice is only divulged to the senior spokesman and one or two other members of the delegation, who maintain a discreet silence. This is not just to hoodwink sorcerers, but more specifically to prevent the news from spreading to the victims who could run away to some other part of East Africa if they learned beforehand. The secret is only shared with other leading moran and patrons closer to the time when the two will be seized and installed by force."																															215	No	"Two dances recur in eunoto and express complementary aspects of moranhood. In the ‘lion dance’, the lion-skin trophy headdresses are worn by their owners or on less formal occasions by some other moran. This dance is a motif that encapsulates the exuberant spirit of moranhood. The other dance, emosiroi , is the exact converse: subdued and lacking the element of exuberant spontaneity. It is performed by visiting delegations [Page 148] and by moran when their patrons wish to impose their authority. The elders themselves may join in and married women may faintly follow it as onlookers. This dance seems to express unity and submissiveness to ritual obligations. It bears the imprint of peace and conformity as opposed to the competitive associations of the lion dance: the 4th quadrant of Figure 8b as opposed to the 2nd. In Maasai idiom, dancing tends to be synonymous with ‘play’, but emosiroi is a dance when this would be an inappropriate term.Episode 2. Ruffling the firestick patrons and the ritual of counter-rebellion . The Meto manyata arrived too late to allow the first stage of the eunoto proper to be performed at the new moon towards the end of March. It was therefore necessary to delay this stage a further month. During this period, an incident in the Meto village provoked the firestick patrons and dealt a further blow to the prestige of the Meto moran. One of the firestick patrons at the festival was Mebugu, the ritual leader of Nyankusi L . His wife was a manyata-mother at Meto and it was highly appropriate that he should attend the festival. However, it was important that he above all other firestick patrons should be respected and maintain his dignity, and also his wife, who by custom had been chosen for him by his age-group. One evening, a Meto moran entered her hut and started to make love with her daughter, ignoring the mother's presence and protests. She was furious and complained to the patrons. They regarded the incident as an outrage against Mebugu himself, and a symptom of the prevailing disrespect among all moran. When Mebugu heard next morning, he could not conceal his anger. As ritual leader, he had a powerful curse, but he was also obliged to respect the collective will of his age mates. Their first task was to coerce him to restrain himself while they took on themselves the responsibility for castigating the moran."																															216	No	"As the time for moving from their temporary villages to the eunoto site draws near, the manyat are joined by non-manyata moran and they migrate as a whole age-group. The apprehensiveness of sorcery surrounding this move helps to build up a sense of occasion. The eunoto site itself is kept secret so that it cannot be tampered with beforehand. A protective line of chalky ‘medicine’ provided by the Prophet is traced on every forehead from ear to ear for the move. There is also a false start to divert misfortune from the migration proper that follows. This is a theme that is repeated later that day with the installation of the ritual leader, for he too is thought to divert misfortune from his age mates who follow him to elderhood. This concern with threats from sinister forces coincides with the transformation that the age-group of moran undergo through eunoto . It marks an implicit shift in the distribution of power with age more generally. The juxtaposition of large numbers of older men and younger men sharply differentiated by age highlights their differences. The maturation of the moran is a fact of life that arouses ambivalence, clearly expressed in Episode 2 and other incidents of the kind. Even the firestick patrons, whose future is ritually linked with that of their moran wards, [Page 151] have a vested interest in delaying the reality of the present. This is to suggest that the kind of insight offered by some informants, that the danger from ‘eyes’ emanates from society at large, could logically be extended to interpreting the dangers that are felt to surround eunoto ."																															217	No	"In the 1977 eunoto , the installation of the ritual leaders resolved the uncertainty regarding their identities. General concern for their position now shifted from apprehension at their prospect as ritual victims to deep respect for their seniority as ritual leaders. Shortly after the installation a firestick patron took me to one side to emphasise in tones of awe how much everyone - and not just the moran - respected these two men because they were truly ‘great’. Meanwhile, they could be seen in the two villages with their distinctive insignia. They walked together, visited various huts, exchanged quiet greetings, but did not join the dancing that attracted other moran so readily. In their presence, the other moran had to restrain their high spirits. The notion of the ‘greatness’ of these two was [Page 154]Figure 9 Principal phases and movements of the Matapato eunoto festival[Page 155]Map 4 Matapato eunoto 1977: the joint manyata and ritual leader's villages.[Page 156] echoed in the claim that with their installation, the whole age-group of moran had become ‘great’. They were one age-group. In future there would be a more marked sense of respect between them all and the world at large"																															218	No	"The regard for the ritual leaders as individuals is very similar to the normal deference expected in the presence of any gathering of age mates, for they carry the authority of the whole age-group. The moral authority of the ritual leaders is expressed in the form of a powerful curse. If the ritual leader plucks out one of his hairs or throws away a bead from his blue necklace as he utters the name of an age mate, then the victim's ‘heart has been plucked out and thrown away for predators, and he will not live two days.’ In practice, it is the positive aspects of the role of ritual leaders that are emphasised, but their power to curse looms over this role. Two months after the installation in 1977, the ritual leader was still an isolated figure. While others chatted, he had an aloof manner and was indecisive in his actions, as if uncertain of his role and preoccupied with his inner thoughts. The deputy ritual leader, on the other hand, now appeared relatively relaxed and able to enjoy the company of other moran, taking events in his stride."																															219	No	"Apart from a few premature elders who are shadowy anomalies and in no sense moran, the ritual leader should be the first of his age-group to settle down. At a time when the moran are promoted to become ‘great’, he is installed as the figurehead and becomes greater still. He is obliged to adopt a lifestyle that is a caricature of docile elderhood. By becoming an elder, he makes the elderhood of all other moran more credible and imminent. Given the mystery that surrounds him (and his deputy to a lesser extent) one is led towards surmise and a suspension of anthropological disbelief in psychological arguments. Because he should be wholly uncontroversial as an individual, there can be no resentment at who he is, but only at what he stands for. On the one hand, he is ‘great’ and has a powerful curse, but on the other he is threatened by an uncertain misfortune. This ambivalent notion suggests that he is the focus of powerful forces converging on the whole age-group at this point of their career. Some Matapato suggested that his misfortune lies in the manner of his installation which is devised to divert the smouldering resentment of the firestick patrons away from other [Page 167] moran. An informant in Loita suggested that it stems from the resentment of his age mates because of his coercive powers (as in Case 17). 9In Loita, the ritual leader's hut is regarded as a place of sanctuary for homicides and for boys who are being hounded by moran after filching privileges. Much of the resentment of moran was said to result from this protection given to fugitives. The Matapato denied this practice among themselves. However, they accepted that it would be a legitimate use by any ritual leader of his powers of coercion to bring his age mates closer to the ideals of elderhood.In relation to these beliefs regarding the source of the ritual leader's misfortune, one may compare similar notions concerning the early death of the Purko senior spokesman of Terito, Olemutelu (p. 107). In Purko also, Terere of Talala age-set was unique in combining the roles of both senior spokesman and ritual leader on the advice of their Prophet. However, even in Purko as in Matapato, there is an emphasis on the separateness of these two roles normally."																															220	No	"This misfortune threatening the ritual leader is quite separate from the notions of sorcery that threaten the eunoto . The threat to the ritual leader is diffuse, whereas the threat posed by sorcerers is altogether more specific. If anyone, it is the senior spokesman who is the most obvious target for jealous sorcerers, for he has power and his death would throw the whole age-group into disarray. It is for this reason that the Prophet gives the spokesman ‘medicines’ and charms to protect him, just as his age mates surround him in battle. It is the senior spokesman who is first to perform each act required of the moran at eunoto precisely because he has the protection of the Prophet and the ability to cope with his instructions. Provided he can follow these exactly, the wiles of sorcerers cannot get past him to the ritual leader who performs these acts next, or to others who follow. However, the ritual leader is in no way protected from his own prospect of misfortune, and it is popularly held that this is beyond the Prophet's powers. The Prophet is expert in coping with man-made sorcery, but he cannot intervene against providence itself. At most he can help select an ideal candidate as ritual leader, in order to protect the age-group at his expense. The threat of misfortune persists at least until the ritual leader is mature enough and prosperous enough to confound popular belief. Even then the belief may persist in the rumour that the patrons or someone else fudged eunoto , and that misfortune after all has bedevilled the remainder of the age-group instead."																															221	No	"A variety of symbolic clues seem related to the beliefs surrounding the role of ritual leader. Both he and the spokesman are liable to run away from their installation, given a chance. The complementary positions of these two can be related to the metaphor of the feather headdress: the neatly arranged circle of ostrich feathers that enhanced the stature of a moran in battle. The spokesman is described as the ‘head’, and those who surround and advise him are the ‘feathers’, enhancing his effectiveness (p. 105). The insignia of a ritual leader is a feather plucked from one of these headdresses and erected on a cane staff, rather as he was plucked quite literally from the circle formed by his chanting age-group at his installation - to be erected outside the circle and by himself. From this point, a veil of cultivated respect is drawn around him, cutting him off from the intimate camaraderie of his fellows. This respect is not unlike that for an age-mate from another part of Maasai. He should lead a quiet life and remain insulated from controversy and even gossip that might irritate him. The spokesman on the other hand is thrust to the centre of age-group affairs and plays a key role in resolving any controversy. The intriguing [Page 168] feature of the incident that involved the ritual leader Mebugu was that he was precipitated into a controversy. His age mates then had to exercise their coercive powers over him as a group to restrain him from venting his natural feelings and the damage this might cause (Case 31 Episode 2)."																															222	No	"Another peripheral figure, but in a quite different way, is the diehard whose insignia was a battle knee-bell mounted on a staff. The depersonalised role imposed on the ritual leader contrásts strikingly with the highly personalised stance chosen by the diehards. In terms of the model of Matapato stereotypes (Figure 8b), the diehards thrust themselves towards the extremity of the second quadrant as assertive warriors. The ritual leader, on the other hand, is thrust towards the submissive extremity of the fourth quadrant. In these two representations, one has a contrast between a commitment to warrior values as against an imposed and peaceful elderhood: anger as against equanimity, resort to physical force as against powers of moral coercion, the avoidance of married women as against an arranged early marriage, and the possibility of great fortune as against the threat of poverty and misfortune. Both representations are placed in the forefront of the dangers to which their age-group is exposed. The diehard is a warrior who plants himself as mainstay in the battle-line. The ritual leader is the man-who-is-erected (or planted upright) as the mainstay in the transition towards elderhood. Eunoto is associated on the one hand with the ritual leader and on the other with the flamboyant raid that follows, a raid known in some parts of Maasai by the term used for diehard in Matapato."																															223	No	"This brings the argument back to the principal features of sacrifice noted earlier in the chapter, and the transfer of life and renewal from the ox to those who share in ‘passing through’ it. The parallels with the transformation of the ritual leader at eunoto are striking. A sacrificial ox is selected by the Prophet from anywhere in Matapato for its propitious markings: the ritual leader is selected by the Prophet from anywhere in Matapato for his propitious and unblemished credentials. The patrons kindle the fire for roasting the sacrifice and imparting life to their wards: they also kindle a fire for installing the ritual leader and this imparts life to their wards. The sacrificial ox is suffocated with a woman's apron: the ritual leader is installed by seizing him, forcing a woman's apron over his shoulders, condemning him to a constricted future and possibly an early death. The sacrificial ox is made happy beforehand with singing and beer: a belated attempt is made to bring happiness to the ritual leader with singing and the gift of a cow with calf, and later a wife. Finally, the sacrifice of the forest-ox is the act of erecting the age-group through their ritual leader: it is ‘the ritual leader's ox’. The parallels and associations are so close that one is led to view the imposition placed on the ritual leader as a form of sacrifice. If thère is a certain analogy with birth and renewal in the sacrifices of eunoto , then equally one can point to an analogy with death in the transformation of the ritual leader. This goes beyond the sense of suffocation experienced by a shaking moran when he feels his basic urge to fight constricted by the conscience of his age-group ideals. In the case of the ritual leader, he is singled out and the vitality of his being is consumed by his age-group. His misfortune is their fortune and his early death is their long life. He is close to Frazer's concept of a divine king, with all that this implies for the transference of evil onto the sacred object, or as Freud might have put it, the projection of the guilt of their rebellion. However, in Maasai terms he is more than a scape-goat that is driven out. He leads his age-group upwards, bearing the brunt of the dimly perceived resentment against their passage towards elderhood. This is not expressed in terms of ‘eyes’ or of sorcery, but of destiny itself; and it is this that marks him out as great."																															224	No	"The ritual leader should marry soon after eunoto , ideally before any other moran, and his wife too will be respected as though she belongs to a senior generation. She is a gift from his age-group. If he dies young, then at least they have tried to ensure that he has had a chance to found a family of his own. Like the ritual leader, she is chosen secretly from a propitious family and is co-opted through a form of coercion. In place of a conventional gift of ‘anointment’, moran from another manyata area slip into the village of the unsuspecting girl and place round her neck a chain that has been doctored with the Prophet's ‘medicines’. She too is expected to scream and rage, and then her mother, realising what has occurred, tries to prevent her throwing away the chain - and her own life. The mother may then slip it round her own neck for safety. This form of betrothal overrides any other arrangements the father may have made for the girl."																															226	No	"Next morning, with a thoughtlessness for which there could be no excuse, I pressed Mandara to come down to camp and see my guns, &c., in which he took so much delight. Up to that time he had never asked me for a single article, and I was so charmed by his princely ways, his great intelligence, and other unusual qualities, that I could not resist the desire to show some little attention to him. He had not intended to go down, but after some importunity on my part he consented. Going off in front to prepare for his reception, I found all well in camp. The Wa-chaga, on hearing that their chief was coming, scuttled off in great trepidation, as if it was his habit to chop off the heads of all who came in his way--and indeed, it was one of his greatest delights to see the abject terror of his subjects, over whom he wielded the most absolute authority. On his arrival I showed him all my guns, instruments, &c. The galvanic battery threw him into fits of astonishment, till his cagle eye gleamed with covetousness, and he spat and whistled [Page 83] himself dry, requiring incessant libations of pombè to sustain him. He intensely enjoyed ordering his chiefs and warriors to submit to the electric current, and he simply gloated over their evident though suppressed terror, while they with difficulty kept themselves from yelling out or wriggling on the ground. They stood the trial, however, admirably, with the self-control proper to warrior chiefs. Mandara himself refused to experiment, afraid of being bewitched. Neither would he stand to be photographed,"																															227	No	"Taking only Muhinna and Brahim with me, and going empty-handed, I started off. After a hot march of four hours through a dense bush, where we lost our way, we entered [Page 76] upon a cultivated part, and were put in the right road. Reaching a blacksmith's shed, we fired the customary three guns which announces a stranger from the coast, and then waited till told the chief was ready to receive us. After a short time we were called. Traversing a rich banana grove, and crossing an open space, in which were several cows feeding, we found ourselves face to face with a group of fine-looking, aristocratic Wa-chaga. They were sitting under a shed, enveloped in voluminous lengths of cotton dyed in ochre. As no one spoke when I entered, or rose to shake hands with me, I uttered a general salutation, and sat down on a log of wood. Compelled at last to relieve my awkward reception, I asked which was Mandara. A powerfully-built man, of princely bearing, was pointed out to me. With a face which for a negro might be called intellectual and capable of expressing every emotion, he had an eye like an eagle's but only one --the other had lost its light for ever. These characteristics I noted in a glance, and then commenced my speech. I explained where I had come from, and where I was going; I stated that, having been compelled to leave the trade-route owing to the Masai, I proposed to camp at the boundary of his domains, and that, having heard so much about his great achievements as a warrior, of his princely character, and his delight in receiving strangers from the coast, I could not possibly pass so near him without giving myself the pleasure of coming to see him."																															228	No	"Shortly after joining the kraal, Moran was called upon to record his vote in the election of a Lytunu and a Lygonani. [Page 253] The Lytunu is a warrior elected by a number of kraals as their captain or leader, with absolute power of life and death. He is their judge in cases of dispute. He directs their battles, though, curiously enough, he does not lead his men, but, like the general of a civilized army, he stands aside and watches the progress of the fight under the direct command of the Lygonani. If, however, he sees symptoms of his men wavering, he forthwith precipitates himself with his bodyguard into the battle. Of course he holds his office purely on sufferance, and if he fails to give satisfaction he is summarily deposed. This, indeed, is almost the only attempt at a form of government. Each war-district elects its own Lytunu. The Lygonani, again, is a very different personage. He is the public leader of a kraal, leads and guides the debate in cases of dispute. To be such arrogant and pugnacious savages, the Masai are the most remarkable speakers and debaters imaginable. In some American novels we have the Indian belauded for his eloquence and dignity; but commend me to the Masai for grace and oratorical power, for order and decorum in debate; and, indeed, for most of the good qualities which in these days are conspicuous by their absence in our own House of Talking. Not that their genius in this line is always worthily applied; for in their finical persistency in talking out a question they might even beat our Parliamentary Obstructionists. They will spend days discussing the most trivial matter--nothing, indeed, can be settled without endless talk. But we must proceed with our history."																															230	No	"Another reason for the suburban quality of Buganda is the constant mobility produced by frequent mobilization. Buganda is a system admirably adapted for war, and was in an expansionist phase when intervention occurred. Chiefs marshaled their followers to military encampments and the forces were relatively mobile, dispatched over the excellent road network which the Baganda constantly maintained. Yet because of the high quality of traditional agricultural capacities, a stable and dense population provided the foundation on which the military and political superstructure was built. Stability and physical mobility, military expansion and internal security, were characteristic. The pivotal center was a person, the Kabaka, rather than a place. In addition to moving his capital, he went on frequent safari. With him went large masses of followers and retainers who were joined by those on the spot who immediately took temporary place in his entourage."																															231	No	"Provincialism was very important in Buganda because, unless a traditional counterpart could be found, it exerted a drag upon the efforts of political leaders to create new and important political groupings. Temporary political groups and alliances formed only for limited purposes. Only the limited purpose organization was possible, not the durable and well-organized party. What formed instead were political associations rather than political movements or parties, a pattern which has continued until today. Nationalism was of such a nature that if a movement were to develop, it would be an all-Buganda movement, parochial in nature and directed against an external threat. Outside interference caused people habitually to rally around their official leaders, no matter how much they disliked these leaders on other grounds: no other important intermediate groupings held powerful attachments for the people. 3"																															232	No	"One result is that anyone who enters into political life or becomes socially prominent needs to defend himself against the intrigues of others. Such protection is afforded by building up a following—a group of intimates who can be relied upon for support and loyalty. In its own way, this duplicates the old chieftaincy pattern, at least to the extent that some measure of a man’s importance is judged by the number of followers upon whom he can call."																															233	No	"Thus changes in marketing structure to include cash crops have not been so drastic that the entire pattern of social organization has changed. Atomistic and resilient, the commercial economy has not displaced the older tradition of a society based on political ranks and rule. 51Some have argued that the marketing boards have also inhibited the expansion of the African economy. It seems debatable whether or not the benefits of the marketing boards as a general source of investment funds in the country and as a fiscal control device in the country are less important than full returns of proceeds to the farmer from the sale of cotton and coffee. The Royal Commission argued that Uganda pays far too much attention to concerns of security and smoothness in the process of development. Nevertheless, it seems clear that Africans do have all the propensities for entrepreneurship but find it appealing to invest in land rather than in commercial activities. See Royal Commission Report, Chapter 5, “The Dilemma of Security.”Land traditionally brought both prestige [Page 57] and political power. Success is still measured in political terms. What is valued is prestige derived from landowning, with the possibility of becoming a mutongole chief or being recruited into the Buganda government hierarchy."																															234	No	"Here was a system of rights and obligations, of courts and territorial organizations, of higher nobility and a witenagemot . There were freemen and serfs. The country was divided into territorial groupings similar to shires; the kingdom was an aggregation of shires ( sazas ). The “church” was older than the state. It had its own councils but functioned in a fashion intimately related to politics. And to make the parallels even more complete, at the time the Europeans arrived the system was changing toward a more classically “Norman” type of feudalism. The king was consolidating supreme authority. As with the Norman kings, huge estates were granted to loyal followers. The holdings were unconsolidated; a powerful chief might find his land scattered in several different areas."																															235	No	"The principle of autocratic kingship, then, did not interfere with the practical affairs of Buganda. Reforms resulted not in a major type change but in the establishment of a bureaucratic system. Chiefs were still appointed in the name of the Kabaka, only now they were civil servants."																															236	No	"Here the top figure is the paramount or king. He combines in his role symbolic, integrational, ethnic, and other functions. 11For a more detailed discussion of the functional requisites of chieftaincy, see my book, The Gold Coast in Transition (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1955), passim .[Page 94] Subordinate chiefs have power at the king’s pleasure and normally they administer territorial units within the kingdom. Such systems usually have a problem in gathering information and have councils which serve such purposes, but in no sense can the councils be regarded as “legislative” bodies."																															237	No	"Each chief holds administrative responsibilities and today can be promoted, demoted, transferred, and retired, although originally nothing like such stable tenure applied to the role. At the pleasure of the Kabaka, chiefs could be removed from office and shifted around in various positions of responsibility, but the differentiation between chiefs was a good deal more vague than now. There were Bakungu chiefs and Batongole chiefs, the former being generally more important than the latter. The most important of the Bakungu chiefs were in effect the governors of those provinces which today are counties of the Kingdom of Buganda. Others were the Katikiro or prime minister, who at one time was also commander-in-chief of the armies; the Mujasi, 12The Mujasi was first established by Kabaka Mutesa I when the practice was initiated of having a standing army.who became the general of the armies; the Gabunga or admiral, who was also a mutaka of the Lungfish clan; and the Kimbugwe, a household figure whose nominal responsibility was to take charge of the king’s umbilical cord—an object of great religious veneration in customary practice. "																															238	No	"Whatever his position in the hierarchy, each chief holds his mandate from the Kabaka, but subordinate chiefs serve the chief next higher in the echelon. The Batongole chiefs are most intimately associated with the affairs of village life and with the ordinary people ( Bakopi ). With the establishment of civil service chieftaincy, the Batongole were not included in the paid hierarchy. Today they remain important in the contemporary system of local government. Batongole are in the main selected because they are landowners, 14Roscoe defines Batongole as the private servants of the king. They were the staff of the king, including servants, guards, policemen. They were given estates in the counties and were directly responsible to the king. Today they are landowners who represent the lowest level of chieftaincy. ( Ibid., pp. 257-258.)"																															239	No	"The solid circles denoted by K 1 , K 2 , and so on, indicate Kabaka’s estates which are his private patrimony. Scattered throughout the various sazas, these estates are controlled by the deputies of the Kabaka himself. In the past, important chiefs were often given charge of these estates which served to secure the counties more closely to the king through the presence of king’s men and king’s land. Further, since it was customary to shift the capital of the Kabaka and there was no fixed locale for his residence, the roving quality of his authority further emphasized the fact that boundaries between sazas were simply administrative conveniences and not local solidary groupings. As a result, the allegiance which attached to the chief was an allegiance which attached to the king. Indeed, when some effective and powerful chiefs made alliances against the Kabaka and with the other members of the ruling family eligible for kingship, it became the practice to kill the potentially competing eligibles. This tended to establish the king more securely.Senior chiefs (Bakungu) as well as the king had properties scattered through the counties. These properties were primarily attached to the office, not ascribable to the individual; in effect, they as well as the office reverted to the Kabaka when an occupant was removed or died"																															240	No	"The pattern of recruitment was as follows: Pages were sent to the court of the king by clan elders and chiefs. They were selected [Page 98]Diagram Efrom families who had in some way distinguished themselves, either as chiefs (and almost every chief had a son at court) or as other notables. However, it was not necessary to be either the son of a notable or a chief in order to be selected as a page, or to be among the pages selected for chieftaincies. Hence no permanent social barring was present. 15Ibid., p. 244.Indeed, because so many of the sons of chiefs had been killed either in war or intrigue, it was a common practice of the chiefs to send their slaves’ sons. If a slave’s son was sent he went as a chief’s or elder’s son and was, of course, a clan member. 16Partly for this reason (since the child takes the father’s clan except in the case of the royal family), and partly because of the expansion of Buganda, the tracing of Buganda ancestry usually uncovers some non-Muganda ancestor, giving rise to the frequent charge that some chief or powerful figure is not a Muganda but a Munyoro. This was a favorite way of initiating the downfall of a public person."																															241	No	"In effect, then, the system was basically hierarchical with the king as “patron” and chiefs and subjects as “clients.” Each of the Bakungu chiefs had special duties with respect to the king. For example, Mukwenda, the Saza Chief of Singo, was his shield-bearer; Sekibobo, the Saza Chief of Kyagwe, was his governor in Busoga, a neighboring country to Buganda, part of which acknowledged the suzerainty of the king of Buganda. Kasuju, the Saza Chief of Busuju, was in charge of the princes and princesses, [Page 99] assisted in the appointment of a new king, and managed the estates of the king’s family."																															242	No	"The traditional system was well differentiated on grounds of [Page 103]Diagram Gpolitical hierarchy. Rank was determined by authority granted by the Kabaka and measured in the number of people under the control of a chief. Unlike the system in Toro, Ankole, or Bunyoro, no aristocratic principle prevailed. Bakopi or peasants could rise in the hierarchy. Princes and princesses were a relatively minor aristocracy. The selection of sons to inherit their fathers’ estates was largely a clan matter, subject to election. Primogeniture did not exist. Even at the most senior levels rigid dynasty was mitigated. Recruits to the Kabakaship were numerous. Many children were eligible for the position because of the large number of wives possessed by the Kabaka. The “harem” system worked as a fairly efficient safeguard against bad kingship and was not accompanied by primogeniture."																															243	No	"The Buganda government would continue to be responsible for most of the internal affairs of the Kingdom. For their part, the Baganda were concerned to safeguard the position of the Kabaka and chiefs. The boundaries of Buganda were confirmed and the Kingdom enlarged to 20 counties, mostly at the expense of Bunyoro, [Page 110] the defeated rival of Buganda. This provided for an expansion of stable offices. The distribution of chieftaincies on the basis of religion, which had been reorganized by Sir Gerald Portal in 1895, was essentially confirmed in the Agreement when land was allocated to 1,000 chiefs and notables. Freehold land, although previously unknown, was introduced. 1It is sometimes alleged that the butaka, or clan burial lands, were traditional forms of freehold, but this is not the case. These were lands relatively sacred and relatively immune from supervision by the Kabaka or chiefs. The conception of freehold was introduced by Johnston.A hierarchy based largely on political control was reinforced by economic wealth in land which could be inherited. This introduced the potentiality of a political-economic class system which had hitherto been alien. 2This class factor became important but never rigid or exclusive. True the term “noble,” applied to a senior chief who was now also a big landowner, was occasionally applied to Bakungu chiefs. In this fashion a rudimentary dynastic element was introduced into Buganda. But many of the landowners sold their land or subdivided extensively. With other forms of means available, it was not uncommon to find a retired school teacher who, having saved his money, bought some land, farmed it successfully, expanded his holdings, and became a large landowner and prosperous farmer and a Mutongole chief.Another reason why the dynastic element was not entirely successful was that the sons of chiefs were rarely of the caliber of their fathers. Even though such institutions as Mengo High School were set up to cater to the sons of chiefs, mostly the sons were less satisfactory than the fathers and in the civil service chieftaincy system merit was important. Hierarchy thus came to be based on merit rather than family."																															244	No	"The Agreement created generational problems. In 1900, major chiefs were relatively young men, steeled in war, shrewd, and by the standard of the time the best educated. Many of them had been closely associated with the missionaries as pupils, readers and catechists. Young, aggressive, and capable when they came to office, they continued in office for several decades after the Agreement and retained their preeminent positions. Few chiefs were anxious to see power slip from their grasp. Even their older sons were able to obtain only minor chieftaincies. The latter’s prospects for promotion were rarely good. By the time the senior chiefs were ready to retire, a third generation had already grown up (the Makerere generation), anxious to wrest power from the older chiefs. Members of this third generation, if they had inherited land, received only small portions of the original grants. By this means, although the newer political aspirants were most often related to the old dynastic families, that dynastic element had been vitiated. Indeed, education expanded to included a much [Page 111] wider group than chiefs’ sons. By the third generation after the Agreement, even some Bakopi (peasants) were clamoring for entry into the chiefly hierarchy on grounds of ability and education. 3I am indebted to Mr. E. M. K. Mulira for very fruitful discussions of these issues. Some of the ideas contained here were stimulated in these discussions."																															245	No	"When the king died, it was traditional for the Katikiro, the Kimbugwe, and the Kasuju to assume responsibility for selecting a new king from among the eligible princes of the drum. The position of the Katikiro was now made immeasurably more powerful, while the latter two household officials, who had had ready access to the Kabaka and could exert considerable influence, were removed from their direct position at the court. The Katikiro’s judicial and financial powers were divided between two new officers, the Omuwanika and the Omulamuzi . These formed a regency during the Kabaka’s minority and, as well, a council of ministers of the Kabaka’s government. Mugema, the last of the clan heads to be an hereditary saza chief, was deprived of some of his lands as a Mutaka, even though these were compensated for in mailo lands received by him in the Agreement. More junior Bataka were deprived of their lands entirely. The Agreement reduced the power and prestige positions of those primarily in the clan sector."																															246	No	"Below the most senior officers of the government were the chiefs, ranked in order of importance by titles which showed the relative significance of the territory over which they ruled. Each chieftaincy post had an official estate, the income being enjoyed by the chief during his incumbency. New economic distinctions were added in the form of private estate-holding families. A dynastic feature was characteristic of the Kagwa, Kisosonkole, Kulubya, Mulyanti, Kasule, Mugwanya, Kisingiri, Yakuze, and Mukasa families. 4Although the dynastic system does not prevail, it remains a decided advantage to have come from one of these families because between them there has been extensive intermarriage and they have supplied a large proportion of the leaders of the Buganda as chiefs and notables. Between them, too, was a sense of history, shared experience, and intimacy."																															247	No	"Whatever the conditions of the Agreement, however, the chiefs rapidly realized that they were in fact under the control of British authorities. The power of the chiefs had been heightened by the removal of stringent rule by an autocratic Kabaka. Now the strength of the powerful chiefs derived from their immediate control over their own followers, Catholic or Protestant as the case might be. The chiefs had for the moment consolidated their power [Page 114] with British support, established their strength with the people themselves, and managed to double the number of counties over which Buganda could now exercise hegemony. They were well pleased with these aspects of the Agreement. This was the end of the first or pioneering phase of the relationship between British and Baganda. It gave way to a second phase, political administration."																															248	No	"Internally, however, a Muganda might take his position with the chiefs or with the Bataka, a proponent of one group or the other, and behave accordingly. Meanwhile, as a Catholic or a Protestant he looked to different political leaders as his own. He was a follower either of Mugwanya or Sir Apolo. The curious situation arose where a man might follow the Bataka in matters affecting the allocation of land or compulsory labor, and follow Sir Apolo once again when issues threatening the autonomy of Buganda were involved."																															249	No	"When the dangers of civil war had receded and the people began to pick up and mend the pieces of their society, the chiefs were the leaders of the important religious factions. But it must not be forgotten that they had always been important political figures in the country. They were endowed with two sources of special prestige. One was customary or traditional: most of them had been pages at the Kabaka’s court and were associated with the “natural” process of rulership. The other was by virtue of courage and arms: they had been readers and catechists under the missionaries, often at great personal danger."																															250	No	"A third source of support came from their alliance with British officers. It was the Baganda who fought with the small forces of the Protectorate against the Sudanese. For example, Kakunguru had discovered and routed Kabarega and Mwanga. And in return, the British treated the chiefs with honor and respect. 8Each source of support also came to be a source of conflict. Because the chiefs represented continuity and legitimacy with the past, and held their office in the traditions of the past, they carried over the dispute which the chiefs had had with the Bataka. Because the chiefs were courageous and tenaciously religious, they continued the disputes between Catholic and Protestant (the Muslims having been effectively routed). And because their alliance with the British gave them firm support, it also opened them to influence from an outside force. Thus relations between the Buganda government officers and the Protectorate government officers grew increasingly sticky as time went on."																															251	No	"As a party they used their special advantages well. The patronage opportunities were enormous. Some faithful followers were notables and received land as a reward for their services. As the number of clerkships and inspectorships grew, others were given important positions in either the Buganda government or local governments. Honor, status, and land, all three closely associated with one another, were distributed by the dominant chiefs to their supporters."																															252	No	"As well, the chiefs justified their tenure of office on grounds of ability. They were the most capable leaders whom a generation of conflict had brought to the fore. Schooled by the missionaries, skilled at handling men, they ran a reasonably efficient system of government. Taxes were collected. Peace was maintained. The Kingdom prospered.By means of patronage the chiefs were able to appease their followers. With support from the British their position seemed impregnable. With their ample skills, as compared with the rest of the population, they could justify their rule on grounds of ability. Thus the standard of merit, which had always applied in Buganda, became part of the civil service chieftaincy system. The carryover of old to new was relatively effective.Nor were the chiefs simply the willing tools of the British. They rallied the public behind them on several issues. The most important of these was the autonomy of Buganda."																															253	No	"The religious differences among them did not divide them greatly. Catholics supported Catholic chiefs. Protestants did the same for their chiefs. But offices were fixed allocations according to religion and not subject to controversy. This tended to be true of land, although to a smaller extent. Where there was a Protestant saza chief, the Protestants got most of the land. The same held true for the Catholics."																															254	No	"But it was the economic factor which helped the chiefs become an effective solidary grouping. By becoming the most prominent landowners they had added wealth to their other accomplishments. Economic status helped to weld them into a party anxious to protect its own heritage against those who would take it away from them.Several factors prevented the chiefs from becoming an economic class. First, the system of civil service chieftaincy maintained the separate identity of individual and office. The very tradition of service to the Kabaka prevented individuals from pre-empting as their own the roles which they had assumed. Hence the slow turnover in chieftaincy was explained by the fact that a civil service does not change its personnel quickly, rather than that individuals had become personally powerful and were using the office of the chief as an expression of personal power. Due to the nature of economic and political power, the coincidence of the two had nothing inevitable about them."																															255	No	"Second, the great emphasis on achievement and skill never faltered as a condition of office and as a factor in recruitment. Service to the Kabaka had been the one condition of chieftaincy. Together with education, it continued to be so. In theory, nothing prevented a skilled and educated Mukopi from becoming a Katikiro—nothing, that is, except the fact that his chance was slight and that the leading chiefs continued to occupy the important posts for a long time."																															256	No	"Dissatisfaction expressed itself in several ways. There were common complaints by the Bakopi that they were dragooned by the chiefs into communal labor and forced to pay hut taxes. Though such service had always been obligatory, they recognized that the spirit of it had changed. As old habits and ties were broken up the actions of the chiefs became more distinct. Unlike the acts of the awesome representative of the monarch, the chiefs’ actions did not remain unquestioned. The shortcomings and errors, disputes and jealousies which necessarily attend individual action were brought into greater prominence. Individuals became identified as unpopular, and the Bataka and Bakopi were able to concentrate their fire on the regents of Buganda as those responsible for bringing about inequity."																															257	No	"The Bataka, finding themselves with potential allies among the Bakopi, now reached into both the recent and remote past for arguments which would bolster their position that they had been denied their due not only in land settlement but in the share of the political kingdom. Arguments from antiquity were carried forward cheek by jowl with events of the immediate past. It was argued that the Bataka’s main political power resided in their power to select the pages who were sent to the Kabaka’s court and from among whom many chiefs were selected. Thus in terms of recruitment the Bataka had had an important role to play. Recalling still an earlier time, the Bataka claimed that they also had a right to sit in Lukiko. Thus they sought to “democratize” the Lukiko and eventually came to demand both elective chieftaincy and an elective Lukiko."																															258	No	"Deprived of their estates, the page system abolished, and their presence in the Lukiko eliminated (unless they also happened to be chiefs, in which case they sat as chiefs), the Bataka represented the most traditional and most violated group in Buganda. They identified completely with “old Buganda.” They became the keepers of custom. Just as the chiefs used land as a major issue to gain the support of the public, so did the Bataka. Moreover, what began as their demand for a return of rightful property holdings [Page 125] evolved into a challenge to the leadership of the chiefs themselves. With their monopoly of power and prestige, the chiefs failed to see a vulnerability in the midst of their strength."																															259	No	All the important chiefs were intimately acquainted with the Bible. They quoted extensively from the Scriptures. This intimacy with religious belief brought a double accolade: the first was conviction and self-righteousness; the second was knowledge. Both were useful attributes of a civil servant cum politician.																															260	No	"It was here that the chiefs were so powerful, for, faced with competition, they had reinforced their own positions. First, they were a major political group, defending their interests against others who had not received land in the Agreement. Second, they were the government. As a government, not only did they represent themselves as a party but they heeded the wishes of the Protectorate government. Third, they were the administrators of the Kingdom. They had powers as representatives of both the Kabaka and his government and the Protectorate government. As administrators they were in a position to apply almost arbitrary power."																															261	No	"Equally, at each level of the chieftaincy hierarchy there was a similar pattern of accountability: councils dominated by official majorities whereby important issues were made known at a local level to the nkiko at the miruka, gombolola, and saza levels. If appeals from the decisions of lower councils were to be heard at a higher level, it was the chiefs in Lukiko who had to decide whether or not to forward an issue from a lower to a higher council. Hence the principles of accountability worked on a ramified local government level in much the same way they did on the Buganda government level. It was the chief who controlled the local council, thus it was the chief’s political group which was dominant in local affairs. It was also the chief who in his executive authority wielded the powers of both central and Buganda government at the local level."																															262	No	"Both government and the missionaries became concerned at the controversy. To the latter, a coronation was a solemn and Christian occasion. The Mugema, although a Protestant, could not see the issues of custom as either Christian or pagan. The government, on the other hand, wished to demonstrate that the ceremony was a public and official affirmation of the Agreement itself, binding upon a new monarch about to take office. It was certainly not concerned with orders of precedent for traditional leaders. On the Mugema’s claims for precedence for himself and other customary officials, the Protectorate government referred the matter to the Lukiko. The Lukiko thereby became involved in matters of custom with just the group it felt to be its greatest antagonists, the Bataka. For the Mugema was not only head of the Monkey clan with his special prerogatives as a saza chief. He was also the leading Mutaka in the country. 7To resolve the conflict, two ceremonies had to be held, one [Page 141] European, the other customary. A breach had been made, not so much between what was Christian and what was not, as between “true” Kiganda and “foreign.” From now on, the Baganda’s struggles were associated with the proper position of the Kabaka in the system. With the investiture of the Kabaka, the question of his authority and its legitimacy became important. 8All these issues loomed on the horizon with the investiture of His Highness, Kabaka Daudi Chwa. Conflict between the clan leaders and the chiefs, which had been going on for generations, broke out afresh, this time in the context of a growing Buganda nationalism—a nationalism focusing on the position of the Kabaka himself and thereby on the basic relationship of Buganda to the Protectorate government. This conflict, in the context of the post-Agreement period, threatened to embroil the chiefs in their three capacities, as a political group, as a government, and as administrators. It threatened as well to imperil their relationships with the missionaries and the Protectorate officials, the two outside groups with whom they had hitherto been firm allies."																															263	No	"In the case of Buganda little active interference with tribal government took place between 1900 and 1919. Most of the Lukiko funds derived from court fees and these were left unsupervised by the British. By 1916 the Protectorate became independent of British Treasury grants. The growth of local revenues made it possible to step up the development of education, medical, agricultural, and other government services. Much of this was accomplished through the chiefs who were responsible for promoting cash crops, surveying mailo land in Buganda, and enforcing forestry, veterinary, agricultural, and medical rules."																															264	No	"The Baganda thus saw much to content them. Yet by the very success of their efforts in the political sphere, the leaders of government became careless in the economic and social spheres. The old family groups, those who had received large landholdings during the 1900 Agreement, still ran the Kingdom as if they were a squirearchy. Economic issues now began to loom large, and in Buganda the three main guides to social position were land, education, and family connection. Social position was secured by a rank in the political kingdom. Peasants were now beginning to get education. As well, they wanted land and political power. So much attention had been given to economic matters in the conflicts over closer union that these took on a new political significance. The Baganda were increasingly angry at the economic control of European and Asian merchants. They were beginning to feel that unless the Buganda government paid more attention to peasant demands, it would be serving as the instrument of the Protectorate government and the European and Asian minorities. Thus economic issues came to have crucial significance for the next round of political development in Uganda."																															265	No	"The proportion of chiefs and chiefs’ sons who retained their influence and control in the Lukiko remained high. Kulubya was himself the son of an important gombolola chief in Singo. If we consider the 30 children of Sir Apolo, for example, we find that 5 became gombolola chiefs. One was a deputy Katikiro under Martin Luther Nsibirwa and another became Katikiro in 1945. Nsibirwa, who was in effect the real successor of Sir Apolo, was a very close friend of Sir Apolo, and the circle of intimates around him included Hamu Mukasa (Sekibobo), Amoni Bazira (Kago), Petero Sendiwanawa (Mukwenda), Ezera Kabala (Omuwanika), Susane Muinda (later Sekibobo), and Yosiya Kagwa (Canon and leader of the African priests)—all from important families."																															266	No	"The way to become a chief was to be the son of a chief, have a good education, and get a job in the provincial commissioner’s office [Page 185] or some administrative post in the Buganda government. 2In traditional Buganda, while a chief’s son did not necessarily succeed to office, it was a common practice for him to take the office of his father. See John Roscoe, Twenty-five Years in East Africa, p. 249.One might become an assistant educational officer, or a Luwalo (public works) inspector, or a clerk in the Omuwanika’s office. There, noticed by chiefs or by British administrative officers, the man who did good work would be appointed to a gombolola and move up the chieftaincy hierarchy. Hence one important element for a prospective candidate for chieftaincy was the connections he had, so that the attractiveness of a first job depended on whether it gave the person the opportunity to bring notice upon himself for a job well done. Merit was always a strong element in selection, but in the wrong post merit could go unrewarded."																															267	No	"It will be recalled that the Bataka Association and the Bakopi had made common cause against the chiefs. After 1927 these alignments changed in form if not in substance. For one thing, landlords and Bakopi began to draw closer together in the face of a common problem—cotton income. For another, many sons of chiefs who had inherited land from their fathers proved unsuccessful in succession. Disappointed and to some extent humiliated by the Buganda government, and forced into early retirement, many of these sons turned against the Buganda government and tried to create growers’ and producers’ organizations or to enter business. To do this they had to appeal to the farmers for support. If they failed in their enterprises, as many did, this led them to shift over from the organization of directly economic enterprises to those with an increasing political object."																															268	No	"Aside from the grievances of farmers, a second form of concern developed among the Baganda. After the downfall of Sir Apolo, the administration tightened up. The depression required a cut in costs and increase in administrative efficiency. The Omuwanika, Kulubya, took on the task of revamping the Buganda government system of finance which had become relatively confused and inadequate. Peculation was common. Chiefs had been indifferent [Page 189] in collecting taxes and a general laxness was the rule. Indeed, the chiefs had rather a good thing in general inefficiency and so did many of their supporters in the rural areas. Tightening up tax collection increased their unpopularity with their people. This increased dislike of Kulubya by certain chiefs. 6This came to have important political significance because in the long run the Buganda government was to alienate not only the Buganda public but many important chiefs as well, and had to turn to the Protectorate government for its only source of support. The long-run effect of this was to make the fight over representation and autonomy on the part of the Baganda a fight between the Protectorate government and Buganda political groups, in which the Buganda government pressed from both sides, showed great ambivalence and finally alienated everyone. We shall discuss all these factors in greater detail."																															269	No	"We have mentioned the unsuccessful sons of the important chiefs. These came to play an important political as well as economic role in the late thirties. Many had received considerable education and had been well up on the chieftaincy ladder as gombolola chiefs or better. For one reason or another they had been forced to resign or were suspended. In a population which today is reckoned to be only a little over 30 per cent literate, the presence of a skilled, aggressive group of ex-chiefs, still relatively young, whose pride was wounded, served as a natural leadership rallying discontent against both British officials and the Buganda government. Some, such as Bamuta, had been associated with business enterprise that had failed as well as with failure in the chieftaincy hierarchy. Others, such as D. M. Mukubira, a former President of the Baganda Merchants’ Association, who was later Minister of Natural Resources in the Kabaka’s government and is now a Kabaka’s nominee in the Lukiko, were close to James Miti, the most important leader of the Bataka and one who had been associated right from the start with the Mugema in the Bataka Association. Hence the link was established between disappointed and unsuccessful chiefs, businessmen who had attempted to compete with [Page 194] European and Asian merchants and growers, and the Bataka. 13A letter from Mukubira to Miti as a testimonial of his services includes the following passages: “You have done plenty for this Association (Baganda Merchants’ Association) in discussions in meetings and in giving advice whether the meeting place. . . . You always gave pecuniary help to advance this Association, and what is wonderful is that you have given this Association a place in your home. In short you are the grandfather of this Association and for the uplift of Mother Buganda in all those fields which are the points of discussion among all nations and which are the sources of wealth and of development, I present to you this letter as an everlasting gift to you in your life, given in appreciation of what you have done for this Association.” (Quoted in The Life of James Miti, an unpublished manuscript by P. M. K. Lwanga.)Although an old man, Miti was convicted for his part in the Bataka movement as being responsible for the 1949 riots and was sentenced to a heavy fine after spending some time in jail. He was one of the most interesting of the old Muganda chiefs. He escaped martyrdom during the reign of Mwanga, and was an ardent Protestant. He was one of the first Baganda appointed as a senior chief outside Buganda and, like Kakunguru, was mixed up in religious and clan politics in Buganda, while performing his job as Saza Chief in exemplary fashion in Bunyoro. After his retirement from Bunyoro in 1930, he devoted a great deal of time to clan affairs, and the Bataka Party which developed in the late thirties was in large measure his creation. One of the few carryovers from the original Bataka group, it was he who gave the Bataka Party any authenticity they might have had in adopting the title."																															270	No	"Respect for old chiefs, such as Hamu Mukasa, was evident in the deference and interest shown in them by younger intellectuals such as E. M. K. Mulira. Mulira later became a teacher, a journalist, and the leader of a political party. Everywhere there was the sense of sharing in a common cultural heritage which literate and illiterate, chiefs and people, Kabaka and schoolboys, found it interesting and exciting to explore."																															271	No	"It was not enough to claim descent from an important family. Family prestige gradually became separated from power as an element in social distinction. Prestige came to be based as much upon participation in church, old boys’ association activities, lecture and literary societies, as upon family itself. Although they predominated, descendants of chiefs’ families were not the only members of these groups. Belonging to an old family made it easier to participate in such groups and thereby in such prestige. But lack of family connection did not mean absolute disbarment. Many of the new chiefs and many who came into clerical and functional positions around Mengo, the Provincial Commissioner’s office, and the county and district offices, were drawn from these new and important associations, such as the United Budonian Club, or were Makerere College graduates. And through a variety of mission schools and an African teaching-clergy of Bakopi origin, Bakopi were absorbed into the “clubs.” Thus no strict pattern of self-segregation of chiefs’ sons or grandsons and Bakopi occurred. It was well known whether or not an individual had land, but only at the most important levels of government was this important."																															272	No	"Clan and tradition in these affairs served a direct political purpose. The most progressive chiefs had also been the religious stalwarts. The tradition of religious austerity and strong character had been exemplified by Sir Apolo, and to a large extent he served as a model for Nsibirwa. The Old Bataka was composed of many people whose religious attachments to Christianity were as profound as those of Sir Apolo. However, the more radical chiefs, such as Wamala, were less devout, less educated, and in revolt against those who identified too strongly with church and government. Thus part of the attack against Nsibirwa was against a stiff-necked churchman and against the Anglican Church. This was given substance during the Namasole affair when religious stalwarts such as Hamu Mukasa, a former Sekibobo and a highly respected figure, were forced to resign from the Lukiko because of their support for Nsibirwa and their Christian view that the Queen Mother could marry anyone she wanted. This was regarded as anti-Kiganda."																															273	No	"The provincial and district officers were upset by the behavior of the chiefs. The autocratic and domineering chief refused to move with the times. There was great affection for the progressive, if somewhat stern chief, who retained an independent demeanor but who allowed a good relationship between himself and the district officer. Few such chiefs were to be found, although they remained the ideal. 2Introducing a representative principle was indeed helpful. But public complaints continued to be widespread in many districts. In some areas, such as Busoga, the perennial demand was for mailo estates in the Kiganda pattern. After a number of land tenure commissions inquired into it, it was decided that Busoga could not have mailo estates. This formed the basis of a general charge of discrimination. Accusations were made that Europeans would steal land.In other areas, such as in Bugisu, the development of high-grade coffee brought increased income but exacerbated land and clan disputes, made more complex by the fact that no indigenous chieftaincy system existed, although certain headmen had been elevated to the position of chiefs when the Kiganda pattern of local administration was introduced."																															274	No	"Inside the Lukiko there was now an elected element anxious to have more power. This consisted largely of small businessmen and farmers. They obstructed the proceedings of the Lukiko. In an interesting paragraph in the Buganda Government Annual Report, the Resident pointed out that not only was there increasing estrangement between chiefs and people, but the elected members also were a major source of difficulty. “It would not be out of place to say here that one of the most important causes of this [gap between chiefs and people] was evidently that the newly appointed unofficial members of the Lukiko, who had a year or two previously been brought into the government of Buganda as a measure to assist in associating the ordinary people with their appointed leaders, had shown in almost every instance a lamentable lack of responsibility and had nearly all failed properly to appreciate their positions. These people, who represented but a fraction of the electorate, such was the lack of interest in the elections shown by the Ordinary Muganda, normally used their [Page 243] newly-found power to criticize and attack constituted authority and to persuade the common people that it was they, and not the Chiefs, to whom they should turn for help and guidance. This gap between Chiefs and people, which was complicated by the fact that many of these unofficial representatives were men of extremely poor calibre, was therefore one of the first of many important problems which had to be faced. . . .” 10"																															275	No	"The chiefs were a major bone of contention. The Bataka began to demand elected chiefs who would be popular representatives, that is, subject to public pressure. Elective chieftaincy would also serve to put their own members in the reformed Lukiko since they were confident that Bataka Party representatives would be elected to chieftaincy."																															276	No	"As people gathered outside the Lubiri, the Kabaka wrote that he was prepared to see representatives of the people but warned that a large meeting would produce a disturbance of the peace. Nevertheless a crowd began to gather at Mengo. Although it was illegal for an assembly of more than 500 people to gather there, the number of people quickly surpassed that figure. A delegation of eight representatives of the Bataka Party was admitted to the Kabaka. They presented five demands. They asked for democracy and the power for the people to select their own chiefs; 60 representative members in the Lukiko; abolition of the present Buganda government; the right to gin cotton; and free trade and the direct sale of produce in the outside world. They argued that often the elected representatives to the Lukiko acted as chiefs rather than popular representatives. And the chiefs did not relay popular feelings."																															277	No	"In colonial territories and in those nations that are trying to achieve goals for which the public is not immediately prepared to sacrifice voluntarily, political parties play a somewhat different role. They need to do more than capture power: they need to establish with the authorities their right to supplant the colonial oligarchy. This is the organizational phase. It is, in many respects, a phase similar to that of trade union organizing. The party speaks in the name of a particularly aggrieved group. The leadership requires discipline from the members. At the same time, it cannot use violence without incurring deportation, rustication, or jail."																															278	No	"One way to achieve organizational strength is to find a leader who speaks for all and seems to identify with the common interest, while widely regarded as a person with special powers of foresight and ability which border on the mystical. Such a leader, if he can hold in his hands the power of moral propriety over others, is indeed powerful. Then the party receives voluntary public following. 2The rather commonplace view of African politics as more “personal” than elsewhere derives from this. New leadership roles require considerable symbolic and personal characteristics if they are to become legitimized.If such a system is to maintain itself, however, then the party must eventually take more coercive steps to keep its support. Such highly personal leadership cannot long survive on the basis of a purely voluntary following. What follows after independence is what we have termed the mobilization type of regime. The party takes over the state. Valid distinctions between party and state tend to disappear. The mobilization approach uses the party as the punitive arm of the state and directs the public toward the goals established. Such a system may not necessarily be “totalitarian” but it is by no means free. The real costs are in terms of information. Party leaders lose the knowledge and strength which comes from competitive party politics, often having to rely on a more expensive approach, coercion, in order to maintain a public following. Very often such systems turn into popular autocracies in which public enthusiasm is expressed for an autocratic ruler who identifies himself with the public."																															279	No	"In Uganda the curious situation prevails where the consociational type has not yet been successful and efforts to build one of the mobilization type have been met with the competition of the modernizing autocracy in the form of an African government. Thus the nationalism of the Buganda government, with its traditionalistic leadership in modernizing guise, has challenged both the mobilization approach and the consociational type in conflicts over legitimacy . In order for one form of leadership to supplant another, more is required than a simple shift in allegiance from one to the other. Necessary is a disaffiliation from certain beliefs and institutions to the acceptance of new ones. As long as the Baganda see little to gain from changing their own system of government, the modernizing autocracy, they will not be easily persuaded to accept the new leadership of a mobilization party. Thus the failure of the Uganda National Congress which attempted to become a mobilization party under its former Secretary General, Cambridge-educated Abu Mayanja. 6"																															280	No	"The Secretary General of the Congress was Dr. E. Muwazi, a Muganda medical practitioner. He had been at King’s College, Budo, then Makerere and the Royal Hospital, Wolverhampton, for his medical training. Returning, he was posted to Mulago Hospital until 1952 when he went into private practice. He was much exercised over discriminatory pay scales for African doctors in the hospital in Uganda. The Treasurer General was S. E. Lukabi, a Muganda who was also the accountant for the Federation of Uganda African Partnerships. Other officers included journalists and lawyers, one of whom, A. K. Kironde, subsequently became an Assistant Minister for Social Services in the Uganda Government and a member of the Legislative Council. The leaders’ average age was about 38 years, some being extremely young at the time."																															281	No	"In addition to being the directorate of the party, the Central Committee was closely associated with the parliamentary party, serving as the main disciplinary forum and tribunal within the party. The Committee had approximately 20 members. 25Material supplied here was derived from personal interviews in an unpublished survey done for the East African Institute of Social Research by Neil Ascherson and from materials in the files of the Institute. The Central Committee is of July 1958; its composition was subsequently altered.At first, the leadership was a mixture of fairly middle-aged old-line politicians, such as Musazi, Dr. Kununka, Dr. Muwazi, and J. W. Kiwanuka; there was also a small “Katwe” contingent of traders and very young, highly educated teachers, such as Senteza Kajubi and Erisa Kironde. 26For a time, Kironde was Acting Secretary General of the Uganda National Congress.Kajubi and Kironde represented the most enlightened wing of the nationalist groups in Uganda, the former having done postgraduate work at the University of Chicago and the latter having read English literature and anthropology at Cambridge."																															282	No	"Thus the top leadership of the Uganda National Congress was overwhelmingly ethnically parochial. It was primarily Kiganda, Protestant, and not merely comparatively well educated but from the best educational institutions the country had to offer. The chief specific grievance of these people resulted from differences in treatment of Africans in the Civil Service, which included government medical officers and Europeans. 29This was a very serious concern. For example, for the post of Education Officer the discrepancy between an Indian Education Officer and an African Education Officer was initially £395 per year, although African salaries rose proportionately to Asians’. Salary discrepancies existed for most grades of Civil Service. See Report of the Commission on the Civil Services of the East African Territories and the East Africa High Commission (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1954), Vol. I."																															283	No	"The typical branch consisted of a roster of “leading members.” These were almost always subbranch leaders, that is, activists in more remote areas. They ranged in age from young, confident, and truculent youths to more resentful and suspicious middle-aged traders. Almost all important branch members were farmer-traders, that is, people with both occupations."																															284	No	"Several general objectives seemed to unite them. They wanted elective chieftaincy. They were loyal to the Kabaka (at least in theory). Strong rural membership attachment to the Kabaka acted as a brake on the Katwe group, making the Central Committee cautious about attacking the Mengo hierarchy. Wanting Buganda to be a constitutional monarchy, they were still quite vague about what that meant. On the question of federalism there was widespread confusion. Many Congress followers believed that federalism meant simply self-government. There was considerable sentiment for restricting citizenship to Africans when the time [Page 320] came. Aims of Congressmen interviewed rarely went beyond general agreement with those expressed on the membership card of Congress, and their understanding of these was not very explicit. 32In English the card reads, “1. Unity for Uganda under African Federal Government; 2. Universal suffrage under a Common Roll for all CITIZENS; 3. Self-government at an early date; 4. African control of economy of Uganda; 5. Education, Health and Justice for all.”"																															285	No	"The comments on the questionnaire invite several observations. There was, as we have indicated, the strong desire for self-improvement. A sense of enterprise and a desire to engage in commercial or business operations was common among many of them. These were potential entrepreneurs conscious of the fact that if they did undertake financial risks they would most likely be unsuccessful. Indeed, what was most important about them was that they envisaged themselves in the roles of successful businessmen and farmers. In both instances success would bring them not only stature but leadership. In a sense they would become the backbone of society, given half a chance. Having been barred from that, they became “political entrepreneurs,” seeing their futures in terms of political activity. Not important enough to participate in the Buganda hierarchy, and unsuccessful in achieving high status in their occupations, most of them saw possibilities in political [Page 325] work. As two comments indicate: “I would like to have general studies as well as borrowing a lump sum of money to enlarge my business at a bigger scale”; and “Besides completing Secondary VI I did three other years of studies in Metaphysic, Logic in the Major Seminary of Kahofondo. I have not married yet because I wanted to study more, but no means of doing so—I am interested in Local Government Affairs.”"																															286	No	"In this regard, one difference between the branch leaders and the top leadership of the U.N.C. was that so few of the branch leaders were products of King’s College, Budo, or Makerere, compared to the Central Committee where most of the top leaders, such as Musazi, were both old Budonians and Makerere graduates. They represented an “old Makerere” generation, in common with other political leaders and chiefs who had finished their education in the thirties. To the branch leaders the Central Committee represented an educational elite. It is not too much to say that the old school ties among the U.N.C. were, for the branch leaders, an object of envy and respect."																															287	No	"Thus the government establishment is not only sizeable, but it makes the chiefs extremely powerful. Both the Buganda central and local government establishments are headed by chiefs. In the rural areas in particular it is the chief who counts. Political parties can accumulate a temporary following on one matter or another, but it is not hard to see that the chiefs, particularly at the county and subcounty levels, remain the important figures in the political life of the country."																															288	No	"What are the concerns of the miruka councils and chiefs? They serve as basic units of government in which the miruka chief is responsible for the ultimate carrying out of government policy, collection of taxes, and preservation of law and order; and, though he has no official magisterial powers, he spends considerable time adjudicating minor disputes."																															289	No	"Salaries for gombolola chiefs are graded from I to V, with a range of salaries in 1956 between a maximum of £400 and a minimum of £100, depending upon the grade and the number of taxpayers in the gombolola. 27"																															290	No	"The gombolola is the beginning of the hierarchy of bureaucratic politics. Gombolola chiefs make it a point to keep in favor with the saza chief and with Mengo. The gombolola chief has considerable leverage to apply. In his council are all the miruka chiefs in the gombolola. If they support him, he can ensure the success or failure of the work of the saza chief under whose jurisdiction he is. Moreover, the gombolola chief is most often the person empowered to assess taxes. Graduated income tax in Buganda ranges from 30 to 120 s . Disputes over how much tax an individual [Page 366] should pay are common in the case of the aged or enfeebled, for example. The chief can, at his discretion, lower the required tax. Thus the aged, the disabled, and the unemployed are in some measure at his mercy. So important has the tax function become that the gombolola grades are now based upon the number of graduated taxpayers. 28Graduated tax was instituted in the year 1954-1955. Income for the Buganda government was by this means almost doubled, as compared with the old Luwalo system. For example, income in 1954-1955 from graduated tax was £425,327, compared with the previous Luwalo yield of £236,000. See Annual Reports, op.cit., p. 195."																															291	No	"Saza chiefs are of course the most illustrious group in the establishment. In charge of the affairs of the saza and responsible for carrying out Buganda government policy, they are generally skilled civil servants with a flare for leadership. They know how to maneuver and yet remain out of difficulty. Because they have achieved the highest level posting, however, they can afford to be a bit independent, especially if they are in charge of one of the important sazas, such as Kyandondo, Singo, Kyagwe, Bulemezi, or Buddu. 29Both gombolola and saza chiefs go on frequent safari throughout their areas. They visit various gombolola and miruka nkiko, explaining government policy, actions of the Lukiko, and ministerial policy. The particular advantage of the saza chief is that he is an official member of the Lukiko, sits on Lukiko committee, and thus plays an important part in determining the general lines of policy which the Buganda government follows. And as a part of government, he is in a position to report on public reactions in his county. Items of common concern, gossip, or petty grievance are the most frequent. Common questions on safari include the following. In a miruka council meeting attended by a touring saza chief, the question was asked whether or not a fine of 40 s . levied by the gombolola chief for failure to have a sign stenciled on a lavatory indicating the purpose of the building was not too high. Others wanted to know what the people of Uganda get out of the profits on coffee, cotton, and maize grown in Uganda. There were complaints that taxes had been gathered in some areas in the early hours of the morning, the chief routing the people from their beds and making them pay. 30Tax evasion was common and very often a miruka chief coming to collect tax could not find the taxpayer. Chiefs resorted to early morning collections before the taxpayers could disappear for the day."																															292	No	"In contrast, there are 37 clearly significant differences between Makerere-educated leaders and followers; and two others approach significance (Table 21). The differences, moreover, appear very consistent. In comparison with the Ganda followers, more of the Makerere leaders show a tendency tofunction efficiently when confronted with a European-type test (items 3-7, 9-11); to reject traditional beliefs (items 12-16); to emphasize the importance of work (items 17-18); to express hostility or less respect for traditional leaders (items 19-23); to indicate antagonism toward Europeans (items 24-25) and Asians (item 26), although appreciably more think that Europeans and Africans can be close friends (item 27); to suggest hostility toward, but respect for, their fathers (items 28-31); to be more sensitive to human beings in general (items 32-36); to be perhaps less optimistic concerning the future (item 37); and to plan for that future (items 38-39). Virtually all these differences, it has been suggested elsewhere, 4Ibid.Go to end note pageare associated with increased acculturation, not only among the Baganda but also—with appropriate cultural modification—in two other African societies, the Luo and the Zulu, where a version of Schedule A was utilized.

Again the number in the Makerere group is too small to permit meaningful statistical manipulation, but in passing it is provocative to note a surprisingly consistent tendency for fewer of the Makerere group, in comparison with the followers, to report what in European society are often called neurotic symptoms with respect to: difficulty in getting to sleep; the feeling tone of dreams; unknown fears; ease of getting angry; and concern with health."																															295	No	"When the sample given Schedule A was asked to illustrate the qualities of a good leader, most men once again suggested that such a person should reflect rather than affect public opinion.

Firstly, Luo leaders tend to differ markedly from their followers in almost all respects except their reactions to many traditional beliefs; quantitatively the differences are about as numerous as those between the Makerere group and the Ganda followers. Then, secondly, the differences between the informal leaders among the urban Zulus and their participating or non-participating followers are not so numerous as the differences between Luo leaders and followers, but are more numerous than the differences between minor leaders and their Ganda followers."																															298	No	"In this story, a father who apparently had not held the office himself was able to take it from a son who had not exhibited [Page [p. 166]][Page 167] sufficient filial devotion and to bestow it upon another son. The theme of brothers competing for position and for paternal favour is a familiar one in Buganda—and among the Interlacustrine Bantu generally—for the lack of a birth-order rule makes every son more or less an equal competitor. Sometimes, too, an ambitious son may be suspected of hastening his succession by means of sorcery. When Bembe died, the chronicle says, there was a struggle leading to formal litigation over this matter of sorcery:"																															299	No	"Of course we have, in thinking about these imaginary constructions, made a number of ceteris paribus assumptions which are in varying degrees unjustified. When we examine some of these, the problem of assessing the changes in stratification brought about in Buganda by the process of modernization becomes more complicated. In the first place, we have assumed that competition for higher positions is perfectly free, and that it has operated with equal freedom through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. But competition for mobility, it is safe to say, is never wholly free in any society and the principal reason is very clear: men of power and wealth tend to be able to confer competitive advantages upon their children, whatever the values of the society may say. Even where high positions are in fact open to talent, and where ideology strongly supports mobility, children of the élite have advantages, for they are in a better position to acquire that part of talent which is the result of training. Thus, as we shall see, the nineteenth-century Ganda chief of high rank could more easily place his son in the traditional ‘school for chiefs’—the corps of palace pages—than could an ordinary mukopi villager. Furthermore, the impediment to perfect mobility does not end with the bestowal [Page 162] upon the sons of the great of differential advantages in the race to the top. If mobility upward is to be free, so also must downward mobility be, for the talented poor cannot compete successfully unless there are vacant positions to compete for. But, just as the élite are able to give an added push to their abler progeny, so also they are often in a position to cushion the descent of the less gifted of their heirs by easing them into sinecures. In consequence, the intelligent and energetic peasant’s son may find the road upward clogged by a sluggish downward traffic. Particularly is this so in a society like that of nineteenth-century Buganda, in which fertility was highly correlated with rank. Polygyny made chiefs enormously more prolific than peasants and better diet gave their children better chances of survival; this added to the burden of downward mobility which the system had to bear."																															300	No	"The traditional conception of appointive office is quite clear; [Page 170] one may hear it today from any articulate Muganda. The required qualities were cleverness and loyalty; the path to advancement was through personal service or clientship. This process, however, involved two distinguishable elements or stages. Advancement came with able and loyal service, but for this purpose innate ability was not enough. First a person had to be trained and this required that he grow up in a great household, where he might learn by serving and observing the powerful. To this end, a father placed his pre-adolescent son in the palace or in the household of a chief. Nsimbi describes the most famous and important of these in-service training schools, the kigalagala, or corps of palace pages:"																															301	No	"So much for the general characteristics of our élite sample. It is a generally well-educated group and one relatively open to talent. But it is by no means homogeneous in these respects, for there are marked differences among sub-groups. For example, the chiefs, civil servants, ministers, landowners and leading politicians are much more closely related to the 1900 élite than are the other groups. The tendency of these categories of persons to form a relatively cohesive and hereditary ‘inner élite ’ is illustrated in Fig. 18, which shows the genealogical links among a group of them. 64Many other members of the élite could, no doubt, be linked with this cluster of persons if more extensive genealogical inquiries were carried out.Go to end note pageThese people are the descendants of the gentry of 1900, and to the extent to which a gentry may be said to exist in present-day Buganda they are among its leading members. However, some of the groups in our sample are much less gentry-like. The clergy, for example, as has often been the case in other times and places, are almost universally recruited from humble backgrounds. So also, though less universally, are the elected members of the Great Lukiiko. 65For data on an earlier group of members of the Great Lukiiko, see: Richards, 1959, p. 68.Go to end note pageThough exercising a good deal of authority, the Great Lukiiko has not, on the whole, attracted the wealthy and well born. Together these two groups make up the greater number of those persons in our sample whose fathers were bakopi, whose ancestors received no land in 1900 and who attended schools other [Page [p. 203]]Fig. 18. Some genealogical relations among élite.[Page 204] than the two élite boarding schools. But these divisions are not absolute. There are chiefs, leading politicians and higher civil servants who also rose from peasant origins and there are clergy and Great Lukiiko members who are sons of the élite . In one degree or another, the major sub-groups share the characteristics of the élite as a whole: a belief in education, an appreciation of talent combined with a recognition of responsibility to kin and, above all, a faith in the ability of neo-traditional Ganda institutions to deal successfully with the exigencies of life in the modern world."																															302	No	"Among princes, particular distinction attaches to being a [Page 69] mulangira ow’engoma, a ‘prince of the drum’, a son or grandson of a Kabaka. Only such a person was traditionally eligible for the throne. Princes more distantly related in the patrilineal line to the ruling Kabaka are balangira abamabundugu, ‘princes who have dropped away’, or balangira abakopi, ‘peasant princes’. There is little in the way in which they are treated to distinguish these latter from peasants; their style of life is the same and they have no special privileges. They may receive some small degree of extra deference, but enjoy no economic or political advantages. There remains, however, even in the case of very distant princes, a residue of royal eligibility which is recognized in the great reluctance of kings to appoint princes to important chieftainships. Princes of the drum were closely guarded, and even sometimes killed, in order to guard against usurpation, for there was no rule of seniority among siblings and each was therefore a possible focus for revolt. 6Princes not chosen to succeed had to formally renounce their rights at the coronation. (See: Richards, 1961. It is clear, however, that this did not always prevent them from plotting against their brother.)Go to end note pageThe fact that even the peasant princes, theoretically ineligible to succeed, were kept out of positions of power, indicates that even they were not entirely without the quality of potential kingship."																															303	No	"Another way to be distinguished from a mukopi is to be a mwami —a person who rules. Where the distinction between mukopi and mulangira is one of ascribed status at birth, the distinction between mukopi and mwami emphasizes instead achieved status, for most of the positions of substantial power in the kingdom tended, particularly during the later part of the nineteenth century, to be open to the talented man upon appointment by the Kabaka. The Prime Minister ( Katikkiro ), the king’s officers ( batongole ) and most of the territorial chiefs ( bakungu ) were royal appointees, chosen in most cases from among the hundreds of boys who were sent to the palace to serve as pages ( bagalagala ) to the king. The idea of a successful career as a reward for effort and talent is expressed in the phrase kukulakulana mu bwami —‘to rise in chieftainship’. Aspiration to social mobility is central to Ganda life and it is rewarded by the kitiibwa (honour) which is the accompaniment of success."																															304	No	"Gradually, however, through at least two distinguishable processes, the independent authority of the Kabaka grew at the expense of that of the bataka . First, the Kabaka acquired a degree of control over the succession to clan and lineage headships. Thus, many lineages seem to have originated from royal appointments in the following way: the Kabaka might appoint a member of an existing lineage to an official post in some other part of Buganda and as a mark of favour might grant him an estate in that area. Gradually the estate would come to be known as butaka and the descendants of the chief would claim the status of an independent minor or major lineage. According to one account, it was in this way that the line of the Gabunga came to hold the office of admiral of the canoe fleet and ultimately displaced an older line as head of the lungfish clan. 29Ibid.Go to end note pageIt was natural in such a case, where the office in question was one of critical military importance, that the Kabaka should continue to exercise a good deal of influence in the selection of a successor. In recent times it has been accepted that the Kabaka is ssaabataka —chief of all bataka —and that all successors to clan and lineage headships must be presented to him for his approval.A second way in which the Kabaka extended his control was by simply displacing clan and lineage heads from areas ruled by them. As time went by, larger and larger areas passed by royal grant out of the hands of bataka and into those of the appointed chiefs and officials—the bakungu and batongole ."																															305	No	"Outside the palace enclosure were the shrines occupied by the most important mediums when visiting the Kabaka, the residences of the palace officials, and the compounds of the Katikkiro (Prime Minister) and all the other chiefs and officials appointed by the Kabaka. Although the latter were appointed as administrators of territorial divisions of the kingdom, they in fact spent a very large part of their time at the capital attending court and hence the affairs of the territories under their control were almost always in the hands of deputies ( basigire, literally ‘entrusted persons’). In traditional Ganda thought, it was necessary for chiefs to be constantly at the capital in order to indicate their loyalty. A chief who remained at his own headquarters was suspected of plotting against the Kabaka. Thus chiefs were hostages, so to speak, for their own good behaviour. There was also another reason for their constant presence at the capital. The non-routine tasks which the Kabaka required of his servants were largely of a military nature and chiefs wanted always to be available for command of a raiding expedition, success in which would bring favour and promotion."																															306	No	"In attempting to characterize these kingdom-states, especially in the form in which they were first seen by the Western World, it is useful to contrast them with the tribes which bordered them on the north and east. These Nilotic and “Nilo-Hamitic” tribes had socio-political systems based primarily upon unilineal descent groups and age-grade organizations. In contrast to this, the Bantu kingdom-states were characterized by territorial rule of a paramount ruler. These paramount rulers were chosen from among the members of royal kinship groups. Subordinate officials or “chiefs”, who were in charge of territorial subdivisions, were sometimes junior princes, but more often they were commoners chosen either by hereditary succession within commoner lineages or by the personal choice of the rulers. The relative prominence of these latter forms of political selection, particularly the last, marks the “Interlacustrine” kingdom-states (as they are often called) off from most of their Bantu-speaking cousins of central and southern Africa."																															307	No	"Most characteristically in Buganda when the Western World first hears of it, ultimate control of land was in the hands of the Kabaka . He appointed chiefs ( Bakungu ) to administer territorial sections for him and they, in turn, had sub-chiefs under them. These chiefs were responsible to the Kabaka or to his first minister, his Katikkiro, for supplying tribute in the form of goods and services from their respective areas. This meant supplying the Kabaka and his court with food, bark cloth, beer, timber and firewood, as well as military service and labour when called for. The important chiefs and sub-chiefs were entitled to a portion of the tribute. This system extended to the headman, who was in charge of one village."																															308	No	"Buganda, especially at the time of the great power of the Kabaka, supported many craft specialists. The Kabaka and the more important chiefs had potters, drum-makers, smiths, and canoe-makers, often with special titles and privileges, attached to their households. However, in the villages the tools, weapons, vessels, clothing, and instruments were made by the peasants themselves or by part-time specialists. In comparison with the groups living around them, the Ganda impressed the early travellers as exceptionally advanced in their arts and crafts."																															309	No	"Under the traditional system, tribute formed the basis for public finance. Peasants paid their headmen and chiefs in goods from their land. Chiefs and headmen further assessed the peasants to support the chiefs above them and, ultimately, the Kabaka . Tribute consisted of recurring amounts of food, beer, milk, firewood, bark cloth and other products, as well as labour for keeping up the roads and the households of the chiefs and the Kabaka . There was another form of tribute as well—military service. The strong central political organization of the Kabaka and the wealth of his country allowed him to command large forces for both land and sea fighting. The bulk of the army always consisted of militia, but during the latter part of the nineteenth century there was a standing army as well. Large forces lived by commandeering food from the chiefs of the areas in which they stopped and the power of the Kabaka insured that co-operation would be forthcoming."																															310	No	"It has been described how each village consisted of separate homesteads spread out over a hill, each homestead surrounded by its individual banana gardens. It has been pointed out that in Buganda the chiefs held authority over areas of varying size, depending upon their position, their favour at court or their office in the clan. But at the lowest level each village had a headman, who allocated land to those who applied to live in the village. The applicant might or might not be related to others living in the village. Villages varied in size according to the location, the fortunes of war, the fertility of the soil, the popularity of the chief, and other factors; most villages, however, would contain between thirty and one hundred adult males and their households."																															311	No	"The Kabaka, once established, had great power in his own right, which he exercised throughout the kingdom through his court officials and his chiefs. In the section on land tenure we discussed the various forms of estates in Buganda, and these must be kept in mind when discussing the administration of the country. To administer the territory of Buganda, aside from certain clan lands and certain private estates, the Kabaka had client chiefs, bakungu, whom he appointed from among those people he felt most confidence in. It was usual for these chiefs to be commoners. At the time of first recorded history, there were ten major client chiefs ( bamassaza, sing. owessaza ), the chiefs of large areas with relatively fixed boundaries. These ten chieftainships [Page [p.62]][Page 63] were ranked and it was possible for a man in favour to move up in the hierarchy. At the same time, as Cox has shown, some of these ssaza chieftainships were hereditary, and more were hereditary in the past than were so in the late nineteenth century. 80 As we shall see below, in the nineteenth century the power of the Kabaka increased and he became strong enough to appoint chiefs where previously the position had been inherited."																															312	No	"During his reign Kigala was beloved by his men as a fine and gentle king. [He reigned until he was very old, when he asked and received from his chiefs permission to resign in favor of his son. His son soon died and Kigala Mukabya Ku[unknown]gubu was again restored to the throne.] (216) When he became very old and was almost blind, his chiefs went into his royal palace and selected his best looking wives. Since he could not see to distinguish among them his chiefs took this advantage of him, and fell down on their knees giving thanks for the women he had given them. At the same time his most prominent wives gave girls away in exchange for the marriage fee. [Eventually this good old king died and was buried at his capital Mandja. His jaw was taken to Dambwe Hill] in Busiro."																															313	No	"When [Kiimba became king] (216) he remained at Mpumude at the capital of his father Kigala. . . Kiimba was a bad king. His chiefs and all his people complained of his cruelty. When he heard this he named his palace Ko[unknown]komibi Lyerinanyini Kigagi, “An ugly lizard is owner of the marshes.” This means that whether a [Page 22] prince is ugly, mean, or stupid makes no difference, he is still the king’s son. He named his twin Wamala, 1 which means, “Since you were crowned king, you have no need to worry, for everything is yours.”"																															314	No	Girls who were sent to the palace and whom the king had not actually married nor appointed to any regular position were the group from whom he selected wives. . . . . If the king wished to give maiden servants to his wives he ordered a chief to go out among the peasants and select the best-looking girls. Women captured in war also served as maiden servants in the palace. The king divided them among his favorite wives and their immediate subordinates so that these might maintain their positions of dignity.																															315	No	"In order to distinguish these feudal chiefs, they wore brass rings around their legs and several hair crests on their heads. They were exempt from arrest for either civil or criminal offense."																															316	No	"In their search to prove the hypothesis that East African states were built by people of northern origins, some scholars have pointed to such things as regalia, cultural and religious practices. Culture historians have stressed aspects of the so-called divine kingship, such as burial customs, the sacred fire and the claim to have descended from the gods. 2 But while all these speculations may contain some truth, it is important to remember that rulers the world over have always recognised the political value of claiming descent from the gods or of linking their high offices with heavenly powers, because even if such a claim did not make them gods, it at least put them above other men. In Europe, for instance, one witnesses this phenomenon in the coronation ritual. In Ankole, the Bahinda dynasty recognised the political advantage of claiming genetic links with the Bacwezi because they knew that the latter were worshipped as gods throughout Ankole. Turning to the question of regalia, it is a fact that since the dawn of history kings have worn crowns as symbols of royalty. Kings or chiefs or even modern presidents have accentuated their majestic positions by the use of materials as titular symbols. Then as [Page 93] now, they sit on raised platforms or chairs or stools called thrones, wearing special garments, holding a spear, a sceptre or a stick, or having a drum as a symbol of leadership. All this paraphernalia in its various forms is as universal as the concept of a leader. To attempt to trace it to a single source or origin is to treat African history as if it were a tribal affair."																															317	No	"The territorial expansion of the kingdom enhanced royal authority in a variety of ways. New territories created new administrative posts, which meant that the king had more jobs at his disposal to fill. As we have pointed out, Kings Mutebi and Mawanda dismissed many holders of important traditional offices and filled the vacancies with their own favourites, who had no traditional claim to any office. All these new men were the king’s own creatures and he could, therefore, transfer, demote or even dismiss them without fear of violating any ancient custom or privilege. As the number of such chiefs increased, so did royal power. An equally important aspect of foreign wars was that they brought in plenty of plunder—women, livestock and ivory. These spoils provided the king with a definite pay-off to the whole nation. The political significance of this has been well summed up by Fallers. ‘This pay-off to his favourites’, says Fallers, ‘goes far to explaining the prestige and legitimacy which the king enjoyed, despite his arbitrariness and despotic cruelty.’ 2"																															318	No	"Mawanda surpassed all the past kings in interfering with the existing structure of government especially as far as the big families of the Bataka were concerned. For instance, he transferred the seat of government in Kyaddondo from Mbuya to Kasangati, dismissed the incumbent and installed his own nominee of the Pangolin clan. In Kyaggwe he did the same thing by dismissing Mbazira, the incumbent Sekibobo of the Bird clan, and filled the post with Nkalubo, one of the heroes from the Busoga wars. In Bulemezi he ignored Nabugwamu, the incumbent, and appointed Matumpaggwa, the general who had won the war against the Banyoro vassals. This was indeed an administrative revolution because the king nominated his personal followers to many important chieftainships."																															319	No	"The rapid increase in the number of chiefs was the direct result of the expansion of the country. Acquisition of new territories meant increased administrative and military duties and thereby led to the establishment of Ebitongole. What were the Bitongole and why were they established? As we have seen above, the original administrative unit was the county (saza). Once the counties had been filled, other administrative units for worthy subjects had to be found. Hence the establishment of the Bitongole, which were primarily administrative departments and not military units as others have suggested. 1See Low, ‘The northern interior, 1840-1884’, in Hist. EA, pp. 297-351. Low’s views on Kiganda military organisation appear in pp. 332-8.But because the duties of defence and administration were inseparable, a Mutongole chief, like a county chief, was always a military leader of his followers. King Kamanya formed many Bitongole to settle these areas and at the same time to check invaders. Thus one finds that by the reign of Mutesa many Bitongole had been formed precisely because administrative and military functions had increased. Some Bitongole were bigger than the counties and their chiefs were more influential than some of the county chiefs."																															320	No	"Despite this jostling for power there is enough evidence to show that most kings had the wisdom to appoint able people to the highest offices. First, nearly all Kiganda sources when they refer to a king also have a word about his chiefs, such as the prime minister. If they were bad men, as in the cases of Kings Kagulu and Jinju, or if they were good men and peace-loving, as in the case of Kings Ndawula and Namugala, the sources record the fact. If the prime minister had special qualities, as in the cases of Kayira and Mukasa, they are mentioned. In order to select the best men, the kings sometimes carried out what may be described as popularity polls on individual chiefs. An interesting example was the appointment of Mukasa as prime minister in the 1870s. Originally Mutesa had appointed Mandwambi, the Mukwanda. But his mother, a highly political woman, warned him that Mandwambi was unpopular and when Mutesa made his own soundings he found this to be true. So Mukasa became the prime minister and Mandwambi, who had already prepared for his inauguration, felt terribly insulted. If a chief was a brave war leader, that was something which spoke for itself. Wisdom and good counsel were qualities highly sought after as the case of Nyanyintono indicated (see chapters 9 and 10). That was why even when kings succeeded to the throne as young men they generally retained a large number of old chiefs inherited from the previous reign. True enough, kings for their part enjoyed such competition for their favours by the chiefs because it strengthened their position as benefactors. On the other hand, it would be misleading to interpret the achievements of centralisation as the deliberate policy of the monarchy. To make such interpretation would be to credit the kings with higher qualities of statesmanship than anything else in their careers shows them to have possessed. What is clear is that all kings were determined to be strong, though not because of any theory they had discovered or worked out about the value of political power or how to secure it."																															321	No	"In conclusion we can sum up the situation as follows. Our main concern has been to trace the likely origins and developments of the chiefly institution through a period of nearly five centuries. We have examined the Kiganda methods of administration and assimilation of conquered populations. We have also investigated the origins and role of Ebitongole and other chiefly categories such as the Abataka, [Page 126] Abakungu and Abatongole. The evidence has shown that there was a great deal of imprecision between the various grades and that their functions overlapped. To categorise them too rigidly is misleading. The Bitongole were not military organisations and there never was a standing army in Buganda. Every able-bodied male was liable to military service, whether he was a Mutongole or not. Our investigation has shown that chieftainship evolved out of the royal household and the court hierarchy, but it expanded as Buganda extended her frontiers. From about the eighteenth century the kings gathered the threads of power in their hands and made the monarchy the most important instrument of government. By the mid-nineteenth century, the king of Buganda was a great despot, if not the greatest in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. But the situation changed suddenly during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. A combination of factors such as the onset of European imperialism, foreign religions and the personal tragedy of Mwanga II completely eroded away royal authority. By 1900 the political balance of power was decisively in the hands of the chiefs."																															322	No	"Throughout the tributary states, Kiganda influence seems to have been effective. The following account, made by the White Fathers when they wanted to establish a mission in the modern Bukoba district of Tanganyika in 1880, illustrates the political extent of this influence. 1Documents of the White Fathers: account by Father Girault.[Page 142] ‘ “Chaittawa or Kataba” was the king of Buhaya (Uhaya) at this time, and like many Basoga chiefs, he was a typical protégé of Mutesa. His father is said to have been a mere cattle keeper in Buzinza. One day he was sent on a mission to Buganda which increased his prestige enormously. He became a chief when he returned to his country. He then attacked the then reigning king of Buhaya, presumably with the help of the Baganda armies, if not at their incitement; killed him and proclaimed himself king. When he died, his son Chaittawa and not the son of the previous ruler succeeded to the throne. Chaittawa owed his position entirely to the support he got from Buganda. When Father Girault reached Buhaya between 1880 and 1881 and met King Chaittawa, he was greeted in Luganda and the ensuing conversation was conducted in Luganda. Like a faithful tributary chief, Chaittawa refused the missionary permission to settle in his kingdom before he had word from his overlord, Mutesa. Writing to his superior in July 1881 Father Girault remarked that “without real protection from Mutesa, it will be difficult to establish a mission here. Men come every day, beg, loot and attack. One needs a strong and trustworthy agent from Mutesa”.’"																															323	No	"The accession of Kabarega to the throne of Bunyoro demonstrates too clearly the importance of leadership in the survival of many African states. Kabarega had youth, determination and courage. He was by far the most able of all the nineteenth-century rulers of Bunyoro, and from the period of his accession Bunyoro was again alive and probably had ambitions of restoring her former greatness. Kabarega’s dynamism and military prowess have led historians to conclude that his lifelong ambition was to recapture territories lost to Buganda. 1K. Ingham, ‘Some aspects of the history of western Uganda’, UJ 21/1 (1957), 131-45; R. A. Dunbar, A History of Bunyoro-Kitara (1965).As a result of this postulation, some historians have concluded that Mutesa’s lifelong ambition was to crush Kabarega. 2Low, in Hist. EA, pp. 297-351.The evidence, however, clearly shows that Kabarega’s lifelong ambition was the conquest of Toro. When he fought against the Buganda it was only when the latter had attacked him. During the civil wars in Buganda in 1888-90, the Muslim party led by King Kabaka Kalema fled to Bunyoro and solicited Kabarega’s aid. Kabarega readily gave his support to Kalema and the latter returned to Buganda and inflicted a heavy defeat on the Christians. 3But in the final rout of the Muslims the Banyoro who had assisted Kalema are said to have been killed in numbers. R. P. Ashe, who was in Buganda at the time, wrote: ‘But Kabarega’s men who assisted Kalema were heavily slaughtered in their retreat, owing to their ignorance of the routes’ (see Chronicles pp. 143-4).Kabarega however, did not follow up his victory. The 1890s saw the climax of the scramble for the future territory of Uganda. Kabarega had long been [Page 148] known as an enemy of European imperialism and when Lugard arrived at the end of 1890, as the representative of the I.B.E.A.C., he was keen to extend British influences."																															324	No	"All these economic factors contributed greatly to the growth of population. The fact that Baganda could manufacture their own hoes, for instance, meant an improvement in the methods of food production and a consequent increase in food supplies. Better and more abundant food, the improvement in living habits, better clothing and a generally high degree of cleanliness combined to reduce the occurrence of epidemic diseases. As far back as the mid-eighteenth century, the Baganda had discovered that outbreaks of bubonic plague were caused ‘by rats’ and ever since that period any overabundance of rats had to be hunted. Royal capitals and their immediate environment were the areas of the heaviest population. So were the capitals of chiefs and the popular Bitongole. Then as now, the 20 mile radius of Kampala was heavily populated, especially the lake shore. When epidemics broke out, these were again the areas most heavily hit. The growth of population was aided also by the influx of war captives from the beginning of the eighteenth century. Buganda’s contacts with western Uganda resulted in intermarriages with peoples of the Bahima stock and by the nineteenth century, Kiganda physical types must have been more variable than they were before. Kayira’s mother was a Munyoro, and Sir Apolo Kaggwa was alleged to have been brought to Buganda as a slave boy from Busoga. Possession of a Muhima wife was something to be proud of and even today people still refer with longing to some female Bahima physical characteristics such as long necks, fair skins and well shaped legs. Intermarriages were more common in the ranks of the rich. The kings used to present the chiefs with wives, or when they participated in wars they usually got a worthwhile share of the spoils. Since this was also the class which fed and lived better, and above all could afford to marry the most beautiful girls in their localities, their offspring were healthier and more handsome. It was this simple fact of better living and the ability to marry the most beautiful girls in the surroundings which has been ignored by writers. 1Stanley, the nineteenth-century explorer, was immediately struck by this fact when he arrived in Buganda in 1875. He commented: ‘Naturally where there is abundance of good, digestible food, and the climate is agreeable, humanity of the respectable class will generally be found to be well clothed in flesh, be it in Uganda or in England’ ( Through the Dark Continent, ii, 309).Instead they have attributed the [Page 151] handsome appearance of the Kiganda ruling class to foreign origins."																															325	No	"We emphasized in the previous chapter that traditional Buganda essentially lacked both the idea and the reality of cohesive social strata or status groups. In Chapter 4 we shall consider the question of social mobility in modern Buganda, but we may note here that the idea of the status group remains absent. There are ‘educated people’ ( bayigirize ), ‘important people’ ( bakulu ), ‘leaders’ ( bakulembeze ) and ‘rulers’ ( bafuzi ), but there are still no ‘gentlemen’ or ‘aristocrats’ in Luganda."																															326	No	"In traditional Buganda, the kingpin of the network of diffuse, personal political relations which made up the state was the Kabaka. Chiefs and officials, and in a more general sense the people as a whole, were his personal servants ( baddu ). We may therefore note with interest that the Baganda today distinguish—somewhat hesitantly—between the public and private personalities of the Kabaka. In his former role, he receives from the Buganda Government an annual allowance of £7,500 and funds for the upkeep of the palace, the state cars and other symbolic appurtenances of constitutional kingship. In his private capacity he enjoys a privy purse replenished by the rents from the 350 square miles of estates which were allotted to the throne in 1900. On these estates, the post-1900 kings have reproduced the old organization of king’s officials—the batongole . Each estate is managed by a mutongole bearing the title of one of the pre-1900 batongole . 11As we noted earlier, the term mutongole is also used today for the local headmen who act as subordinates to parish chiefs. (See also Southwold’s account in Chapter 5.)"																															327	No	"Nevertheless, in spite of—perhaps because of—their scarcity, lawyers and physicians are important in Buganda life. Both [Page 141] professions are prominent in the leadership of political parties and both loom large in the dreams of ambitious young Baganda. 25In a study of the ambitions of secondary pupils in a school in neighbouring Busoga, carried out by the writer in 1951, medicine was the clear favourite. Busia reports a similar result from Jahoda’s work in Ghana. (See: Busia, 1956.)Go to end note pageWith their European-recognized technical qualifications, they represent to their fellows that achievement of modern knowledge and skill which signifies both great personal success and increasing national independence of European control. But perhaps their greatest significance lies in the fact that they are professions in which the independent practitioner, purveying his own technical skill, represents a common form of organization. They thus represent an important departure in the direction of occupational universalism in a society in which the particularistic patron-client pattern characteristic of the traditional period often carries over into modern institutions. Other modern occupational roles, such as those of the civil servant, teacher or religious functionary, are carried out exclusively in hierarchical organizations which are much more vulnerable to particularism. The norms of universalism and functional specificity are present in the conceptions of church, state and school which have been introduced by Europeans, but hierarchical organization allows particularism and diffuseness to develop sub rosa . The schoolboy who aspires to medicine or the law, however, as so many do, works toward success through independent professional competence rather than through the time-honoured way of loyal service to a master."																															328	No	"Most characteristically in Buganda when the Western World first hears of it, ultimate control of land was in the hands of the Kabaka . He appointed chiefs ( Bakungu ) to administer territorial sections for him and they, in turn, had sub-chiefs under them. These chiefs were responsible to the Kabaka or to his first minister, his Katikkiro, for supplying tribute in the form of goods and services from their respective areas. This meant supplying the Kabaka and his court with food, bark cloth, beer, timber and firewood, as well as military service and labour when called for. The important chiefs and sub-chiefs were entitled to a portion of the tribute. This system extended to the headman, who was in charge of one village."																															329	No	"In some cases, the areas of the chiefs described above were of considerable size and maintained more or less stable boundaries for a long period of time. The county ( ssaza ) areas were established areas of administration, for example, and were characteristically administered by appointed commoner chiefs. It seems likely that, earlier in Buganda’s history, many of the ssaza chieftainships were considered to be hereditary in particular commoner lines. 47Cox, A. H., “The Growth and Expansion of Buganda”, Uganda Journal, Vol. 14, 1950.However, by the end of the nineteenth century, the Kabaka had in almost all cases found it possible to break this tradition and to appoint anyone he chose as ssaza chief. This problem will be discussed later."																															330	No	"Besides these Bakungu chiefs, it was customary for the Kabaka to reward individuals for loyal or outstanding service by giving them control over pieces of land. These pieces were passed on to the individual’s heirs. For the peasants on these pieces of land, the person to whom the land was given was their chief. For the landholder himself and his family it meant that the land should not be given to anyone else and that they could bury their kinsmen there in the expectation of security of tenure. These small pieces of land were treated much as the clan lands described below. In fact, frequently a person receiving such a gift from the Kabaka would move his family and part of his lineage to the new piece of land and feel no [Page 35] need to return to the clan lands for burial of the family, feeling that this new piece could be treated in the same way as the clan lands."																															331	No	"Under the traditional system, tribute formed the basis for public finance. Peasants paid their headmen and chiefs in goods from their land. Chiefs and headmen further assessed the peasants to support the chiefs above them and, ultimately, the Kabaka . Tribute consisted of recurring amounts of food, beer, milk, firewood, bark cloth and other products, as well as labour for keeping up the roads and the households of the chiefs and the Kabaka . There was another form of tribute as well—military service. The strong central political organization of the Kabaka and the wealth of his country allowed him to command large forces for both land and sea fighting. The bulk of the army always consisted of militia, but during the latter part of the nineteenth century there was a standing army as well. Large forces lived by commandeering food from the chiefs of the areas in which they stopped and the power of the Kabaka insured that co-operation would be forthcoming."																															332	No	"It has been described how each village consisted of separate homesteads spread out over a hill, each homestead surrounded by its individual banana gardens. It has been pointed out that in Buganda the chiefs held authority over areas of varying size, depending upon their position, their favour at court or their office in the clan. But at the lowest level each village had a headman, who allocated land to those who applied to live in the village. The applicant might or might not be related to others living in the village. Villages varied in size according to the location, the fortunes of war, the fertility of the soil, the popularity of the chief, and other factors; most villages, however, would contain between thirty and one hundred adult males and their households."																															333	No	"The Kabaka confirmed all major clan appointments. It is doubtful whether he could take away clan burial grounds, but he could certainly greatly influence clan leadership by his confirmation or withholding of confirmation of the appointments and by his right to appoint territorial chiefs over the land surrounding clan land."																															335	No	"He also married 203 concubines and 300 maiden servants.When [Mawanda became king.] (222) he founded his capital at Katakala hill and named his house Kiryokyembi, after that of Tebandeke. He named his twin Simbwa 3 , meaning that he was appointed that all the people might bow down before his honor.He was extraordinarily fierce, brave, and tyrannical. He waged war upon and ravaged the Basoga. Up to date they call any king of Buganda Mawanda. Then he dismissed several chiefs, including Nabugwam who was Ka[unknown]gawo, Kago, and Sekibobo. He appointed several heroes of the war to these vacant offices."																															336	No	"Politically, although Mutesa was loved, there was already a [Page 187] feeling among his subjects that he had lived too long and that he no longer provided the sort of leadership they needed. This lack of leadership may be evidenced by the disastrous failure of a number of Baganda war expeditions attributable to the choice of poor generals. When Mutesa learned that his people were yearning for more vigorous leadership, he felt all the more threatened. What he did is best left to be told by one of the men who served him at this time, Zimbe. When the king heard that the people were becoming restive and that they might betray him and put another prince on the throne, he became terribly frightened. At that time there were many young men who had become chiefs and many who were the servants of chiefs. If one looked to the royal family, there were many maternal relatives who would have been happy to see one of their sons on the throne."																															337	No	It was also at this time that he gave his daughters in marriage to the prime minister and to a number of leading chiefs. He then put Prince Mwanga under the charge of Mukasa and henceforth the chiefs knew that Mwanga would be their king. 																															338	No	"By now Mwanga was a lonely man whose secret plans were being betrayed even by his bodyguard. The young chiefs therefore decided to precipitate the revolt as a [Page 204] matter of military and psychological strategy. They argued that it was better for them to provoke the king to fight while he was still weak, and while they were still united. If he executed any of the leaders, such as Nyonyintono or Kapalaga, or if any one of them defected, so the argument went, that might demoralise the rest. Mwanga too could no longer postpone his plans."																															339	No	"Both these views contain an element of truth. Let us begin by examining the Muslim side. Their assertion that the Christians were bitter because of the manner the offices had been divided cannot be gainsaid. It seemed only natural in the nature of Kiganda politics for the Christians to long for an opportunity to turn the scales in their favour. The traditional way of doing this was by fighting rather than by negotiation, though from this period, one notices the beginnings of accepting negotiation as a means of settling political differences. But the Christians were the weaker party and the only men among them described as brave were the two Kaggwas, Apolo and Ndikumulaga. Though a popular leader, Nyonyintono was by no means a fighter. He was admired largely for his wisdom and caution in handling the affairs of state. The arrival of Dungu, as the Muslims argued, may have given confidence to the Christians and led them to plan the next encounter."																															340	No	"The process of distribution of the spoils of war was essentially similar to taxation. Warfare was organized by the chiefs on behalf of the king, and it was the duty of every able-bodied man to take part in it. The whole of the spoil, consisting in cattle, goats, and slaves, was theoretically the property of the king. It was all brought back to the capital, each chief bringing in the booty captured by his followers. The king took as much of it as he thought fit, and distributed the rest among the chiefs in some sort of rough proportion to the amount they had brought in. They, in their turn, distributed rewards to those of their peasants who had acquitted themselves well."																															341	No	"Peasants’ services to the king, which were organized by means of the authority of the chiefs, consisted in building the houses and fencing of the royal enclosure, weeding the paths all over the country to keep communications open, hunting wild animals, and fighting. Both war and work in the capital might take the peasant from his home for months at a time. There was supposed to be a certain rotation in the assignment of building work. Neither weeding paths nor hunting took up very much time."																															342	No	"All these processes 3[see pp. 132-133-Analyst]produced the same result—the concentration of particularly prized forms of wealth in the hands of persons in authority, so that superior wealth was not the reward of superior economic activity, of hard work or skill in bargaining. But it would be completely misinterpreting the facts simply to dismiss this process as the privilege of a class whose position enabled them to deprive the common people of the fruits of their labours. The chief’s privileges were the reward of his services in carrying on the business of government, his position depended upon their effective performance, and if they were primarily services to the king, one at least of them—the administration of justice—was also recognized as a benefit by the people. Moreover his wealth enabled him to reward his followers—by killing meat for them, for instance, when they were working for him, and by specially favouring with gifts individuals who had distinguished themselves in war or in council—to be lavish in hospitality, and to a certain extent to help the needy."																															343	No	"Moreover, even full performance of these duties did not guarantee the peasant in the occupation of his land. The chief could turn him out and plunder his goods for almost any reason, though the fact that it was to his interest to have as many followers as possible set a common-sense limit to the exercise of this right, and he definitely would not evict an occupant merely in order to give the site to someone else. The peasants on their side could leave whenever they liked, and this was an effective way of expressing dissatisfaction, not only because every chief desired the wealth and prestige of a populous village but because, if his followers dwindled noticeably, that would be a reason for his deposition. According to some informants, the move had to be made by stealth, since if the chief got wind of it he would send his servants to raid the house. So long, however, [Page 159] as he did not forfeit the chief’s pleasure, the peasant’s authority over land in occupation and cultivation was absolute, and the site could pass to his heir when he died."																															344	No	"When a chief was moved, his peasants moved with him or not as they pleased. Only persons who had been especially favoured by him were considered to be under an obligation to go with him, but if he was popular the entire village often followed him. Otherwise, they might wait to see what the newcomer was like, and then go if there was a change for the worse. Upon the death of a popular chief, many of his peasants would try their luck elsewhere."																															345	No	"All these chiefs—with the exception of two of the bakungu whose office was hereditary, a reward for services rendered to early kings by their mythical ancestors—held office at the king’s pleasure. Failure to carry out the duties of government—to remit taxes punctually, keep the paths open, and so forth—cowardice in war, unpopularity, which was taken as a sign of bad government, or any personal offence towards the king, was punished with deposition. Lesser chiefs were even sometimes turned out simply to install a more favoured successor. Conversely, satisfactory service was rewarded by promotion to the control of larger and larger areas. This constant change was a very marked feature of Baganda life. It was every Muganda’s ambition to rise in this way, and there are still old men alive who have held nine or ten different chieftainships. Thus the chiefs neither had nor desired permanent tenure of any one position. The only definite security which a chief had was that he would never revert altogether to the status of a peasant; however deep his disgrace, he would at least be left in control of some ten or twenty men. Moreover, a chief’s heir would normally succeed to his father’s position, and only in case the heir to an [Page 161] important chief was a child would he be given a lesser area or taken into court service with a view to finding a place for him later."																															346	No	"“A kind man deserves to rule others. A peasant will say, ‘So-and-so speaks fairly,’ and he takes him a present. A kind man gets followers, because he does not insist on his rights. He does not make a fuss. No one else could have founded a village like this. . . . If you have two men, where will you get [wealth]? Two men will bring you—what? It [the village] sinks to the ground, it does not rise. But he who has many people will eat sweet potatoes, bananas, fowls, and goats.”"																															347	No	"The general behaviour expected by the peasants of their chief, though it was enjoined only by these relatively vague sanctions and by the fear of unpopularity, nevertheless followed quite definitely recognized lines. An agreeable manner seems to have been valued at least as highly as material liberality, and an ill-tempered or arrogant chief is said to have rapidly lost his followers.But the liberality was also essential. The essential qualities of a good chief were once defined to me as “beer, meat, and politeness.” Peasants who worked for him expected cattle to be killed for them. “The chief would kill cattle when he saw that they were tired; they ate their fill and then worked with all their might.” But he was also expected to distribute meat whenever he killed, if not to kill for the express purpose of making a distribution. Any one who called on him would be given food when the midday meal was served. I cannot tell how much truth there was in the argument used by people who begged from me that they came to me “because they had no longer a chief to help them” (after Bugeza’s death); but I should think there was a certain element."																															348	No	"The other duties of the chief consisted in organizing the execution of the king’s commands in the matter of war, the collection of taxes, building in the royal enclosure, and clearing roads. Of these activities warfare stands in a place by itself, for it was regarded by the people not as a burdensome duty but as a profitable occupation entered upon with eager interest. It has been mentioned that success in war was one of the main ways of attaining wealth and position. One old man said to me when discussing the weather, “The rain [Page 192] did not matter in the old days, when we got what we wanted by plunder.” Though Roscoe mentions various ways in which a man who had killed many enemies was honoured, 1The Baganda, p. 362.it is definitely on the plunder and not on the killing that old men now dwell with satisfaction."																															349	No	"The wives of a prince, a chief or a noble living in a large household took status from their husband and often acted in quite a commanding way to men employed in the household, or to lowly guests; upper-class women still behave in this way today. 4 It is true that old-time princesses were said to have acted like men, to have received the deference due to men, and to have been referred to by male titles. These customs still survive. This does not, however, affect the generally subservient position of the woman to the man and in particular of the wife to the husband."																															350	No	"Women were also traditionally under the authority of other women; in the larger polygamous households of wealthy men in the past, all women, whether wives or concubines, lived in disciplined communities of their own. The three senior wives of the Kabaka and of important chiefs had fixed titles which reflected those used by political title holders at the king’s court. Beneath them the women of the household were arranged in an order of precedence, each with specified duties and well-marked status, even if all were under the supreme control of the male household head. In true Ganda style they used the precedence titles of chiefs— mumyuka, ssaabaddu, and so forth—to indicate the relative status of one wife to another. The pattern of the state organization was also reproduced in the palace enclosure [Page 259] by the giving of office ( kitongole ) titles to royal wives (see Chapter 2)."																															351	No	"Baganda still admire the stance and gait of a chief. This is a slow, dignified, pretentious walk ( kubumba ), ‘as though he trusted himself’. A chief should conceal his emotions from his inferiors and appear unapproachable to them. He should wear an impassive mask and act as a holder and hider of secrets; he must never on any account lose face or show that he has been humiliated. The pattern of behaviour is so stereotyped that any European watching a game of children’s make-believe can immediately recognize the ‘chief’ among the child actors. A man who has to deputize for a chief can suddenly assume the right appearance in an instant, just as he pulls on his dignified white kanzu over his suit."																															352	No	"Rights to military service . Command over a military expedition was a favour granted by the king to a loyal follower, as has been described in Chapter 2, but any subject’s refusal to fight was regarded as treachery to the king ( okulya olukwe : ‘to betray’ or ‘deceive’), as was cowardice in battle. Fallers cites Kagwa’s account of the public humiliation of warriors thought to have failed in courage in battle. There is even an indication that social status and the right to positions of authority depended on ability or willingness to fight for the king. Nsimbi says that women did not receive titles from the Kabaka because they did not fight for him. 43Nsimbi, 1956, p. 4.Go to end note pageAn elderly informant told us that in the past a man with a physical infirmity which prevented him fighting might be known as ‘a king’s man’ musajja wa Kabaka, and even become a king’s favourite, but that such a man would not command a following or be given a benefice or a position of authority. ‘He could not eat authority’ ( talya bwami ), that is to say, occupy a political office. Such values are to be expected in a society organized for predatory warfare in the way that Wrigley has described."																															353	No	"At his accession ceremony the new Kabaka was told: ‘Fight your enemies—Conquer Buganda’, for, as Zimbe says, ‘a kingdom is always conquered, not succeeded to’. 62Zimbe, 1939, p. 81.Go to end note pageIn the same ceremony the king plays at mweso (the board game) with some of his princes and nobles and is described as ‘playing Buganda at mweso ’. It is explained by informants, usually with great enthusiasm, that it is essential for the Kabaka to win at the game. He must show himself cleverer than all his chiefs: ‘He must win! He must win!’ In an account of Kabaka Mwanga’s accession ceremony he is described as having overcome opponents in a ritual fight, after which he gave his shield to an important chief, the Mukwenda, ‘as no more wars were to be fought by him’. 63Ibid., p. 109.Go to end note pageThe king brings his rivals into subjection and thus gives his country order, if not peace. By putting down his powerful subjects he protects the rest of his people. Indeed [Page 285] there are a number of Ganda songs in which the Kabaka is invoked as a bringer of order to the nation."																															354	No	"‘Fickleness’ and ‘treachery’ can also be accounted for in terms of the insecurities inherent in a political system, in which a man had not only to choose a patron but also to be ready to abandon the patron if he were about to be disgraced. In such cases the man who climbed quickest on to the next band-wagon was the most likely to survive. There was no danger greater than being found on the losing side. Hence the phenomenon [Page 307] which has been so characteristic of the history of Buganda: the slow reaction to a change in the balance of power, followed by a very sudden volte-face when it has become clear which leader is coming out on top. A rapid recrystallization of allegiance round the new leader then follows. Dr. Cook, describing the final attempt by Kabaka Mwanga to expel the Europeans, says: ‘If Mwanga wins, three-quarters of the people will go over to him.’ He quotes an important Ganda chief as saying: ‘All Buganda is looking on with bated breath to see the result of the first engagement in Buddu.’ 28 This band-wagon phenomenon, if we may so describe it, is characteristic of this type of political structure, and an understanding of its nature is essential to the student of modern Ganda politics."																															355	No	"Leadership in Somali society was fluid and informal. Personal bravery, skill in oratory and political mediation, or economic largesse could propel an individual to a temporary position of prominence within the clan or lineage; but this conferred no permanent authority on the man or his lineal successors. Clan assemblies occasionally elected sultans to represent their kinsmen to outsiders, but here again the sultans had no inherent powers to enforce their decisions, which had to be taken back to the shir for approval. Any leader’s authority was based on successful performance rather than inherited right. And while certain titles connoting military or ritual preeminence were often passed down through particular lineages, 4 the individuals holding them gave the positions whatever real authority they had."																															356	No	"Religious power, on the other hand, could be transferred from one person to another. In the Somali view, baraka (spiritual power) might be inherited by the descendants of a holy man, a practice which helps explain the existence in Somalia of religious lineages. Moreover, certain kinds of mystical powers, particularly those associated with the written word of Islam, could be transmitted through instruction by a skilled practitioner. However, spiritual authority did not of itself constitute a basis for the exercise of secular leadership. In Somali thought, the power of the saint was counterpoised to that of the warrior and clan leader. 5 Wheras the former was seen as having the capacity to divine, bless, and mediate, the latter alone could defend, secure, and expand the material well-being of the clan. Most religious lineages were in fact neither numerically nor militarily strong, and hence not powerful in a secular sense."																															357	No	"Traditions collected by Michele Pirone suggest that the great Harti confederation which had dominated the northeastern Horn from perhaps 1300 began to fragment in the eighteenth century; the sultan of Majeerteenia, once the nominal head of the entire confederation, retained authority only over his own subclan, while new leaders emerged at the heads of smaller tribal groups to assert their independence from the sultanate. These new leaders, know as islaan, apparently enjoyed power “of a sort more religious than truly political” as they sought to settle feuds among competing local lineages. 23"																															358	No	"Although two examples scarcely constitute conclusive proof, they suggest that by the nineteenth century a knowledge of the mystical arts had become an important component of political leadership. A clan leader who sought to extend his authority over other clans could be aided by an education in the “secrets” of religion, to supplement a prestigious patriline and strong numerical backing (from clansmen or affines). The exercise of mystical powers gave him added prestige and a source of authority that originated outside the lineage framework. 29 This mystical authority was seen to improve his ability as a mediator, as a diviner, and as a protector of his followers. It is no coincidence that the most renowned leader in nineteenth-century southern Somalia—the sultan of Geledi—was believed to be a superior practitioner of all three arts."																															359	No	"However, this interriver confederation was fragile; like most Somali alliances, it depended for its continued existence on shared economic needs, the threat of a common enemy, and strong leadership. During the second half of the nineteenth century, the conditions that had helped generate the confederation changed. In 1848, the legendary Sultan Yusuf Muhammad was killed in a battle with the Biimaal, one of the few Benaadir clans that had failed to acknowledge his authority. Although Somalis seldom attribute military defeat to divine disfavor, they may sometimes interpret major setbacks on the battlefield as evidence of ineffective tacdaar (sacred magic) by the leader, who may then suffer a loss of religious prestige. We can infer that this happened after Yusuf’s defeat and death at the hands of the Biimaal: there is evidence that at least four clans renounced their position as raaciye (“followers”) of the Geledi. 4 While Yusuf’s son and successor Ahmed succeeded in regaining the allegiance of some of these clans, the fiercely independent Biimaal continued to resist Geledi hegemony along the lower Shabeelle. A series of indecisive skirmishes between the Geledi and the Biimaal over the next several decades culminated in a major encounter at Agareen in 1878, where Sultan Ahmed met a death uncannily similar to his father’s thirty years earlier. 5 The battle of Agareen eroded Gobroon prestige still further, and successive sultans of Geledi had neither the religious charisma nor the military power to restore it."																															360	No	"For the family religious ceremonies, the head of the family acts as a pagan priest; for the collective religious ceremonies, the chief of the tribe acts as priest, and so does the king among those populations who have monarchical regimes. Such a religious function of the tribal chief, that is to say, presiding also over the relations between his people and the supernatural world, has greatly contributed to attributing to him special religious and magical powers in the popular mind. These powers have often been the basis for changing the elective regime of the chief into a hereditary one; at other times, however, they have helped to preserve the dignity of rex sacrificulus for dynasties which had lost political power. In the little states, where dynasties [Page 5] have been kept for centuries, the king assumes the figure of an earthly incarnation of the Sky-God; he must avoid, as is also the custom among the Z[unknown]inǵär[unknown]o ( 1 ), going out during the day, to avoid being seen—by means of the sun—by the celestial God, and—among other tribes—he must avoid meeting the glance of kings of neighboring states with equal power. Thus, in Kaffa the people hide when the king goes out, for whoever meets the royal glance dies. We can point out as remnants of old ideas on the magic power of the God’s secret names, those proscriptions which we find in very many 5 Sid[unknown]am[unknown]a countries and in the Galla realms beyond Gib[unknown]e, forbidding the utterance of the king’s real name, for which a fictitious name is substituted. It is even for-bidden to pronounce names which contain the characteristic consonants of the secret royal name."																															361	No	"While the ritual Moslem prayers are held either collectively in the mosques or individually, the collective ritual ceremonies (and especially the sacrifices) are conducted by the father of the family or the tribal chief. It is worthy of note, however, that in those tribes where the rank of chief is not a hereditary one, the right to preside at sacrifices often belongs to the r[unknown]er ‘orrod (“first-born’s family”). In those groups with an elected chief within a tribe with a hereditary chief, if a member of the hereditary chief’s family is present, it is up to him and not the head of the group to conduct the sacrifices.The hereditary tribal chief has everywhere the same magic powers which he had acquired in pagan times. It is up to him, after the sacrifice, to pronounce the formula of benediction for the tribe; there are traditional formulas of ancient origin, recited in order by the chief, while all present repeat after each formula: amîn (with recent adaptation to Moslem). “Amidst need may God give you wealth, amidst disease may He give you health!” “Let God bring forth milk from the cisterns for you!” “Of the two roads, let God make you take the right one, let Him make for you the right decision!”"																															362	No	"The hereditary tribal chieftain can, by pronouncing formulas of malediction, destroy a tribe or bring about grave disasters. The Y[unknown]usuf, for instance, who had once been masters of the entire southern territory of Abg[unknown]al, were cursed by the hereditary chief of the Abg[unknown]al, the Im[unknown]am ‘Umar Hiloulä, and after a series of defeats and disasters they were forced to withdraw to their present-day borders. As he has power over the communities, so the chief has magical power over single members of the tribe as well: with favorable formulas he can bring about the fertility of women and animals, or, by cursing them, he can afflict them with sterility; he can cure disease or initiate it, etc."																															363	No	"As for the government of the tribe or of the people /Ital. gente, people, family, clan/, the chief -- hereditary or elective -- has, according to the tradition, the duty of presiding over the three fundamental functions of the tribe: the vendetta, marriage, funerals. We shall speak about this later, and then we should note the following gradual reduction of such powers little by little as the expansion of Islamic culture came to limit the ancient Somali social and juridical structure, causing it to evolve in contact with new civil forms ( 1 ). The chief of the tribe or of the people was then supposed to ensure the peace of his ethnic group; and thus to decide upon or to agree to a solution for the quarrels among his followers. (Here, too, the Mussulman law has intervened, as we shall see, in the sense of partially taking away such competence from the chiefs.) And, externally, the chief of the tribe or people governed the relations of his followers with the other tribes or peoples, either concluding agreements, like the ones of fundamental interest for the economic life of the Somalis about the pastures and waterings ( 2 ), or discussing the controversies and planning acts of force against hostile peoples."																															364	No	"The assembly discussed the questions concerning the relations with the other tribes -- and especially the questions of blood revenge or wergild --; while those between the peoples of the same tribe were settled directly between the chiefs of the individual peoples. In such a way, the solemn annual assembly was, above all, a manifestation of solidarity of all the components of the tribe."																															365	No	"The Somali tribe has had, in the various regions, three different types:a ) tribe with hereditary chief, in which one people considered ‘first-born’ (‘ orrod ) according to the genealogies gave the chief for the entire tribe, such as office being hereditary from father to son, but subject to the formal recognition of the assembly of the armed men of the tribe;b ) tribe with elective chief, chosen by the elders of the various peoples and this one too subject to the recognition of the assembly, and having jurisdiction over the various peoples genealogically descended from the founder of the tribe;c ) tribe with elective chief chosen by the elders of the various peoples, each of which has its own genealogy from a different founder, but which are federally united, having accepted a common ‘name’ of tribe. This last type is the one widespread in southern Somalia among the Digil Somalis, who, having assimilated pre-existing populations (especially Galla) in the region, where they arrived in the late XVII century, had to adopt a less strict gentilitial arrangement."																															366	No	"The Sultan exercises his power over the fractions of the Migiurtini tribe and over the Discisciu by means of his emissaries, who collect taxes for him and act as intermediaries between him and the chiefs of the fractions themselves. Each fraction has its own chief called “d[unknown]q” or “[unknown]ugâs,” who has the same power in the fraction that the Sultan has in the tribe."																															367	No	"-- The Sultan does not lead the army of the tribe in war. He names a chief of the armed forces. Yûsuf knows the name 38 of the present chief of the Migiurtini army, but he did not tell me what name this office has ( 1. Here, too, the analogy with the constitution of the Arab tribes is remarkable. Likewise among the Galla the army of the tribe is led, not by the tribe-chief, but by a captain called “abba dûl[unknown]a,” “the lord of the expedition.”"																															368	No	"As a social unit, and particularly as a domestic group, the hamlet has no formally installed leader. In the discussion of types of hamlet structure which follows it will be seen that the basis of every hamlet is a nucleus of close male agnates, often brothers, or an extended family. But the smallest hamlet is made up of a nuclear or polygynous family. Every adult free-born male speaks in council and the effective leadership of the hamlet depends upon its kinship structure. Where the hamlet has a permanent composition and is not merely as sometimes a temporary grouping of kinsmen it is led by the eldest agnate of most forceful character and personality. This informal position of leadership is most clear-cut when the hamlet consists of one nuclear or polygynous family or of an extended family under the authority of the father. It is least definite where the hamlet consists of a group of close agnates, but not brothers, and it is here particularly that force of character, ability, and general qualities of leadership cause one man’s counsels to prevail over those of his peers. The emphasis placed on seniority in age and on experience is evident in the title given to the man who in any particular hamlet tends to direct its affairs. Whatever its kinship composition, its leader is always referred to [Page 61] as ‘elder’, or ‘old-man’ ( oday ), as in the expression ‘elder of the hamlet’ ( odayga reerka )."																															369	No	"Most influential elders and sheikhs spend much of their time in the towns and those who can afford to hold town property which they occupy for part of the year at least. For quite apart from anything else, it is important for leaders to represent and watch over the interests of their lineages in administrative headquarters. In addition to participating in court cases in which their groups are concerned, a great deal of time is spent in wrangling with the elders of other lineages and with the administrative authorities over payment of blood-compensation."																															370	No	"There is no hierarchical organization in the cultivating village any more than there is in the pastoral hamlet. There is no village chief or headman and no formally constituted council. But the heads of all the component nuclear families constitute an informal council regulating the internal affairs and family disputes of the settlement. Yet, as in the nomadic hamlet, in most settlements, there is at least one elder whose leadership, in no way rigidly defined and with the power to influence through advice and not to give orders, is generally acknowledged by the members of the village. He is always a man of the numerically dominant lineage round which the settlement is formed."																															371	No	"The influence of the qualities of leadership of the elders of dia-paying group segments is also involved in the stability of the Ma[unknown]hamuud Barkad and the instability of the Reer Faara[unknown]h Hagar. Similarly, although they have recently split up, the Barre ‘Abdille segment of the Habar Tol Ja‘lo were for long united when from their size they could easily have dissolved into separate groups. Their unity before their present division is a reflection of the stature and strength of following one of their principle elders. But the presence of several energetic and ambitious leaders in a dia-paying group tends often to disrupt its stability. Thus it is apparently the presence of a group of able and ambitious elders competing for power in the Habar Yuunis Reer Sugulle some 2,100 strong (male strength) which has led to the division of this lineage into several separate dia-paying groups ranging in male strength from 250 to 700. This tendency towards the disintegration of dia-paying groups, created by rivalry amongst the elders of their segments, seems to be encouraged by [Page 186] competition for appointment as Government headmen and Akils. But discussion of the position and powers of these dia-paying group headmen must be postponed until the following chapter."																															372	No	"In general, respect attaches to age and seniority of lineage. Age in itself, if accompanied by wisdom and long experience of politics and not weakened by senility, is an important factor in the attention paid to an elder’s views in council. But men spent in years who have lost their virility, are not usually looked to for political leadership."																															373	No	"Because of his privileged position and the nominal respect paid to him, he is sometimes offered gifts of tribute ( abaalgud, sado ) and shown other gestures of respect. Sometimes, as on his installation, he may be given a girl in marriage by his people without any payment of bride-wealth. In return, a Sultan is expected to show hospitality. Generosity and liberality earn him praise and fame, often even outside his own clan. In speaking of their Sultans, Somali tend to emphazise the dignity of the office, the weightiness of their words, and the authority of their rulings and decisions. But these are tributes of respect rather than statements of fact. Merely by holding office, a Sultan enjoys little more influence and power than another Akil or elder. It is only through the [Page 207] possession of those qualities which give any Somali elder a following that a Sultan can exert effective leadership. Today, the office is little more than an empty title, and it is the holder’s personality which primarily decides his influence."																															374	No	"The Sheikh’s jihaad shows how although pastoral Somali society is constitutionally opposed to the bestowal of power in [Page 228] such degree on one person, particularly on a sheikh, there is always the possibility that under suitable conditions a man of religion of outstanding personality can marshal widespread public support and assume political leadership."																															375	No	"The leader of a company ( amaanduule, or abbaanduule; from duul to fly or attack) is appointed for his military accomplishments on an ad hoc basis. His is not a permanent position and at different times different men are chosen by the same group to fulfil the role. The leader is entitled to a larger share in any captured booty than that allotted to ordinary members of the party. Those armed with rifles are also allowed a correspondingly larger share in the distribution of loot than those armed only with spears."																															376	No	"Perhaps even more important for consolidating social and political power has been the gradual expansion of the types of resources that can be privately owned, which has enabled some people to make others dependent and thus to control them. Whereas formerly, economic, political, and social status were not tied—as status and leadership were based largely on genealogy and achieved reputation, and dependency implied less economic helplessness—today they are becoming increasingly coterminous."																															377	No	"The most distinctive aspect of the Eila or the Amar as a political unit is the absence of any formalized leadership. Although the Amar is viewed by outsiders as a corporate group as far as its legal responsibility in certain cases, from the standpoint of its members, the Amar is no more than the sum total of its constiuent units or Baits. This is shown in the Amar paper of Aggary which states that matters affecting the Amar be decided upon by all the bait represented by their respective leaders, the awaqil. There is no formalized authority above the awaqil, although one of the awaqil might acquire a position of informal leadership by virtue of personal or other qualities. He will be considered as a mediator and go-between for the various leaders of the Baits. In the case of the Aggary, Sheihk Selouma, the Aqila of Bait Eweida, has acquired such a leadership among the Eilat Aggary. "																															378	No	"But the one important characteristic of the Bait which distinguishes it as a political unit is the existence of a formally recognized leadership in the position of the Aqila (lit. wiseman). The Bait is the only structural unit with such formalized leadership. The Aqila is responsible for all members of his own Bait whose number varies from 20 to 60 [Page 57] individuals. He settles disputes among them and represents them in their disputes with outsiders. He is also the spokesman of his Bait in all matters involving the relationship of the Bait with the other tribal segments. He is responsible for the collection of the bloodmoney from members of his Bait and has the authority to confiscate property of individual members who refuse to pay their share. When a member is financially unable to pay his share, the Aqila is expected to pay for him and collect at a later time when the member is in a position to make such payment."																															379	No	"Many of the informants still remember the time when the camp was under the strong control of the headman who made the major decisions of where and when the camp should move. It was those decisions that determined the safety and the security of the group. The headman had strong authority over members of his camp. Such authority was based mainly on his ability to exercise valid judgments as to whether or not the group should move and the route that it had to take if movement was decided upon. At the present time, and with the diminishing of raiding and tribal warfare in the area, the authority of the headman seems to have diminished along with it. The camp appears at the present time to be mostly a residential unit with minimal leadership and with a rapidly changing composition. Different families join the camp at different times during the year."																															380	No	"The key role in the process of mediation in dispute settlements is done by the Aqila or the leader of the bait. When a dispute occurs between members of different baits, each party goes to the Aqila of his bait who takes immediate steps tomeet with the Aqila of the other party and discuss the matter with him in an attempt to reach a settlement. He acts as a representative of members of his bait and defends their interests in [Page 65] the settlement achieved. In many such interest is best served by taking into consideration the welfare of the other party to the dispute as well."																															381	No	"The judicial process among Awlad Ali of the Western Desert of Egypt has been dealt with in the context of political organization of the group. The main feature of the political organization of Awlad Ali is the absence of centralized leadership. The only formally recognized leadership is that of the aqila, the leader of the bait tribal segment. The sources of the aqila’s authority derive from a number of sources, one of which is his judicial role. It is through him that disputes involving members of his bait are solved. The process by which he performs this crucial function is that of informal mediation in which both the personal qualities of the aqila, as well as the weight of his tribal segment, play an important role. This is especially important in a society with no court system or formal hearing and where durability of any settlement depends on its being accepted by the parties involved."																															382	No	"He may not be educated, but he knows the ’awaiyid; at the same time he stresses the fact that his son will have the education which he never had. Empathy is a primary trait of the charismatic leader and the “cultural broker” who seeks to manipulate social relations. No one could explain to me why Hajj ’Ali did not have an education while his brother (who is only three years younger) and other members of the “status group” do read and write. He perhaps only became concerned in the period of change. Hajj ’Ali, the “cultural broker,” is more politically conscious and creative within the context of two worlds in change."																															383	No	"This heroic view of men as political entrepreneurs is very pronounced in the analysis of chiefship (chapter 6). Chiefs provide a core around which people congregate. They also articulate the political frameworks by their and their adherents’ movements and by the manipulation of their often far-flung networks of relationships. Marriage links play a major role in these operations, and chiefs marry more wives than most other people, partly in order to extend the span of their networks of relationships. Chiefs, then, are ‘big men’, in the sense employed in recent anthropological studies of New Guinea Highland peoples (for instance, A. Strathern 1971). But Peters extends this view to all Bedouin men; everyone seeks to enhance his position in society and to become a chief, if only of a camp. A society where all men strive and compete for power and position develops a close-knit hierarchical network of leaders. In ordinary daily life these men alternately collaborate and compete with one another and frequently change allegiances. But once they perceive a compelling joint interest or, as was the case under Italian colonial rule, a challenge to their very existence, the leadership is capable of uniting and becoming a nucleus around which men may readily rally, and which may mount concerted activities for long periods. Such a viewpoint helps towards a better understanding of how a ‘segmented’ and presumably divided society was capable of waging a long and determined battle against the Italian colonial regime."																															384	No	"Like many others, Lewis accepts the possibility of situational leadership. From the various statements made about this, it seems that a leader is thrown up in a situation of stress, when, presumably, concerted action becomes a matter of such urgency that concentration of the collective mind occurs, resulting in an instant acknowledgement of an individual as leader. Yet, if there is one moment when a consensus on leadership is intractably difficult, it is one of stress: stress itself causes enough problems without compounding it with a decision about leadership. Unless there is agreement on a leader prior to stress, then there is nothing to prevent the chaos of anyone and everyone gratuitously offering their services. Leadership is exercised in Cyrenaica when a camp is moved—every ten days or so in the rainy season—when decisions have to be made about ploughing, when the regular watering of animals is to begin, who is to use the water, how and where men are to gather for communal prayer on the morning of the Great Festival, and on a whole wide range of other mundane occasions. It is no accident that the men who lead in these activities are also the men who are out in front when moments of high drama are enacted or who direct activities from their bases. It was they who led guerrilla groups against the [Page 117] Italians, and who, subsequently, were recognised as shaikhs guiding decisions concerning day-to-day activities. The idea of situational leadership derives from the failure to include within the purview of leadership the unspectacular events of daily living, such as the annually recurring moves to new pastures, the seasonal movements between pasture lands and watering points, decisions about marriage, and the like."																															385	No	"Alongside the idea of situational leadership the twin idea of charismatic leadership is often to be found. Rhetorical powers, argumentative skills, the ability to persuade, and physical characteristics are the kind of qualities which, singly or in combination, are cited to account for the leadership of particular shaikhs, and the Bedouin would concur with the view that such is the stuff of which their shaikhs are made—or of which they would prefer them to be made. While it is obviously true to say that a man’s personality characterises the style with which he practises his power, personality is peripheral to the problem of leadership, neither endowing a man with it nor debarring him from it. On factual grounds alone, charisma must be rejected. One of the most powerful shaikhs in the Cyrenaican desert, his name known throughout the country, was a man of slouching gait, slovenly appearance, a cast in his eye, and inarticulate and disconcertingly drivelly. His followers were aware of the disabilities and lamented them; yet they gave him their devoted loyalty. Another man, one of the most charismatic Bedouin I knew, possessed all the personal trappings of greatness and such a command of language that when he spoke at gatherings he sent those present into deliriums of delight, but his wealth consisted of two camels only; he could count on a large number of admiring listeners, but virtually none followed him politically."																															386	No	"Following his statement about the distribution of shaikhs among tribal segments from smallest to the largest, Evans-Pritchard then proceeds to the contradictory statement that because the tribal system ‘is a system of balanced opposition between tribes and tribal sections from the largest to the smallest divisions, and there cannot therefore be any single authority in a tribe.’ This is followed by a statement that leadership is situationally limited. Finally, he claims that ‘the exact status of a shaikh can only be defined in terms of a complicated network of kinship ties and structural relations.’ Despite the contradictions, Evans-Pritchard, unlike some others, showed awareness of the problem, he acknowledged that power existed, and his suggestion for its definition—taken along with brief and somewhat indefinite references to wealth, transmission of status, and gradings of shaikhs—gives a clue showing the direction in which investigation might proceed. I argue that men became leaders by astute accumulation of resources such as material goods (grain and animals), a following of men, networking of relationships and obligations, and their [Page 120] purposeful application throughout many years. As a preliminary to this, a few general remarks are necessary about the economy of camel herding Bedouin and the kind of possible status differentiation it permits."																															387	No	"‘Agnates are equal’, is a statement the Bedouin never tire of repeating. With regard to certain defined rights and duties, certain jural relations, the statement is true. Factually, it is equally true that each camp, however small, has its shaikh. The presence of shaikhship is clear evidence of differentiation within a corporation of agnates; and moreover, this differentiation is largely within the area of those very relationships subsumed under agnation. An aspirant to shaikhship must accumulate animal wealth above his immediate needs, and if he is to rise above the [Page 167] leadership of a small camp of, say, five tents, he needs to accumulate this wealth to an amount that is well in excess of his needs. To achieve this, he must gain differential access, in his favour, to the agnatic resources of land and water which, subject as they are to agnatic control, are available in equal amounts only on an agnatic distribution. Therefore, leadership of a camp of any size implies that a man has successfully penetrated the agnatic barrier of equality with a differentiation derived from non-agnatic origins. Important among these latter is debt. Expressed as it is so often, within a corporation, as marriage, its prime importance as a device which configures networks in this context lies in the fact that it is bundled together with others sets of relationships — such as the various and diverse constraints contained in affinity and the variety of kinship forms which marriage precipitates — for debt, acting alone, lacks the compulsiveness of claims which grant to a man the capability of transferring the shares of others to his own use. In this sense, debt, as a single-stranded relationship, is tactically useful; it has to be woven with others if it is to provide the durability necessary to plan a strategy. It follows from this that a shaikh, if he is to successfully hold his status and mature in it, aims to strike up a debt relationship with all his followers, and with key men among them is anchored in a bed of multiple relationships. A shaikh must largely carry his followers in several respects: he is the main provider of meat in a camp; he gives freely but carefully of his supplies of wool, milk and clarified butter; he provides camels for transport; and he is expected to provide for the poor on occasions such as the Great Feast, weddings, funerals, and for the numerous contingencies which befall his followers. Each camp, then, is a cluster of tents around a nucleus of surplus, and the shaikh stands at its centre, acting, in one of the aspects of his leadership, as the banker for, and the distributor of, surpluses. Being a follower means much more than extracting gain from a leader. The leader needs to differentiate among his agnates to acquire access to the natural resources, to possess some of the shares of his agnates in them, and thereby gain the power to distribute products, to accede in a de facto sense to proprietary control over them. But to maintain the increase in the flocks and herds which this kind of access permits, he perforce needs to command a labour force, which, in the circumstances, can only be made up of followers. Gifts of the kind mentioned, which pass from the shaikh to his followers, are payment in kind for the labour of some of them 1414 Some men are so deeply indebted to their shaikh that they become pliant and he is able to order them about with impunity.Go to end note page—although it is important to add that among his followers there are always some men, and women, who, by virtue of age and infirmity, are too old to provide labour at least for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources."																															388	No	"Bridewealth is concerned with social relations, and if this variation in amount is to be understood it must be viewed in terms of the nature of the relations that are initiated through marriage, whether these are new, with previously unrelated people; or are old ones being revived; or new ones being perpetuated. Thus, where strong links are already available — as with agnates within a corporation — the relatively small bridewealth documents the desire to add to relationships that already exist by transmuting some of them into affinity. A bridewealth of two camels is a measure of the value of affinity added to agnation. Where there is an absence of a marriage link between two corporations and an alliance is sought, then the bridewealth is likely to be massive — twenty camels if the bride’s group is politically powerful. What this indicates is that a corporation wishes to build up [Page 253] relations of this magnitude. The exact number promised, whether it is eight, ten, fourteen, or twenty, depends on the value the suitor’s group attaches to the alliance. An initial link of this sort commands a large bridewealth; in a succeeding link, say a marriage to the sister of the first spouse, or, in a succeeding generation, to a cross-cousin such as a mother’s brother’s daughter, the bridewealth is of a considerably reduced amount — perhaps four camels. But this second bridewealth is earnest that the now established relationships are desirable and that the intention is to consolidate and perpetuate them. The amount of bridewealth is a most valuable indication of the change expected in a set of relationships. Further evidence in support of this view is given by the status conferred on women who carry a high bridewealth. A high bridewealth endows a woman with high status, enabling her to become a kind of chief woman of a camp; she occupies this role because the responsibility of mediating a major political connection has been allocated to her. 99 Other women may succeed in becoming prominent among women in camp life, but if they achieve political significance recognised by both sexes, it is usually a result of their husbands’ rise to power.Go to end note pageWomen are not merely links, providing the cross-cutting ties that bind men together. Their positions constitute the reference points on the map of any corporate group’s political relationships."																															389	No	"As women age, their daily relations with men of the camp are easier than before. They rarely cover their faces, they go into the male part of the tent more often, they are free to talk with men of all ages, and curtaining off the women’s part of the tent is limited to the infrequent occasions when a gathering of strangers meets in the male part. Past childbearing age, a woman, who previously argued with males within the limits of her own domestic unit, now engages in public [Page 262] discussions, voicing opinions that may be backed by other women in the camp. It is wrong to suppose that because women are not among men during discussions they are no more than isolated units and wholly unrepresented. In most camps a leading woman is present, usually the wife of the camp shaikh, who greets guests on their arrival and entertains visitors in the absence of males. These female leaders rely on women for support; leadership among women is not given them ex gratia by males. Just as most men in most camps are agnatically related, so too, women, drawn from a wide range of groups, are also related consanguineously and affinally. "																															390	No	"The chiefs, needless to say, quickly caught on to the system and soon blossomed out with a style of life theretofore unknown in the Tanani mountains where the life-style of even the most powerful pre-protectorate im[unknown]aren (chiefs) was austere and simple. The chiefs' houses began to grow by leaps and bounds (by corvée, but in this case unpaid) as new walls and towers were added. Bare mud walls were plastered over neatly and plaster incised with zellij-work decorated their guest rooms, this, in turn, covered over with brocades and velvet hangings. Elaborate English silver tea services began to grace the chiefs' tables, setting along-side Austrian crystal tea glasses. Large storage-rooms were added on, where enormous reserves of grain were stored. In the style of the old-time chiefs, they surrounded themselves with retainers whom they unabashedly referred to as “soldiers” ( imoxznyn ). One of them, at least, had his own private prison in his house. Through their closeness with the [Page 46] Bureau, the chiefs obtained monopolies over the importation of certain trade goods, and then monopolies over trucking and transport facilities. The landholdings of those who were appointed chiefs grew apace with their houses, and they thoughtfully provided tamborine-players for the tribesmen who were required to go out and harvest the chief's field before they could start work on their own. Since the chiefs also monopolized contact with the Bureau, if a tribesman had business with the government he had first to get the attention of his chief, and this required at least a small present, perhaps a carpet or a new glass for his tea service (two of the chiefs rapidly ran out of space to store their growing collection of gifts and had to have new rooms built onto their houses for this purpose). The chiefs, to sum it up, aggrandized themselves at the expense of their tribesmen."																															391	No	"Among the chiefs, political alliances by marriage are constant, and each reconciliation is marked by a new union. The innumerable daughters of the family are exchanged like presents. [Page 454] /348 cont./ Soon a great chief comes to possess about a hundred wives, without counting the slaves, by whom he has numerous sons. In imitation of the master, the most comfortable sheiks take several wives, and only the crowd of subjects remains attached to the former familial regime."																															392	No	"The appointment of chiefs lies primarily with the Paramount in Council, which is the Superior Native Authority, but as is natural, Government retain the power of overriding this organisation at any time. This power is normally exercised through the Council and has taken the form on several recent occasions of very full discussions between the Council and Government before a final choice was made. Government has also encouraged the Paramount and his Council to consider a reduction in the number of petty chiefs, with the result that they have recommended that certain of them no longer be recognised.It is essential for the Government to keep a strict watch over appointments because each one affects not only one particular chieftainship but usually several others as well. For, generally speaking, the heirachy of Bemba chieftainships is graded, in several distinct sections and the death of one means not only the promotion of a lower chief into the gap but often several moves up of still lower chiefs, resulting in the appointment of only one new man, and he the lowest. The moves often spread over several administrative districts and one of the aims of this paper is to give District Officers some indication of how the main moves are made and what change of chiefly personnel they may expect. I hope also it will give them some indication as to whether personal or tribal politics are entering into and prejudicing appointments. Such events are very common, because, although the system is complicated it is also very flexible, and personal animosities and friendships have often upset what appeared to be a traditional sequence of promotion."																															393	No	"Descent and succession are matrilineal. The totem of the Paramount and other chiefs descended from sisters of Paramounts is the crocodile, and these men are known as Mwinang’andu (sing). I refer to them simply as the royal Chiefs. But some of the most materially important chieftainships of to-day are not held by Benang’andu (plural) and there are grown-up men of royal blood working on the mines and elsewhere who will never hold a Bemba chieftainship. The fact of belonging to the royal clan makes a man eligible for a chieftainship, but whether he gets one depends upon whether he is born of a senior royal sister. For there never were enough chieftainships to go round all the clan. I use the word sister frequently as a matter of convenience but the word mother represents the ultimate test. A man takes his seniority from his mother, consequently in a large clan it is only the sons of senior namfumu (mothers of chiefs) who can expect to get a chieftainship."																															394	No	"When the spirits decided that Ponde C10’s son was the wrong man this young Lwali Mwamba left his newly acquired post of Mubanga and became [Page 33] Misengo, a post vacated by that chief becoming Makasa. Chief Mukwikile should have been offered the Mubanga, and that he was not is due to the reasons mentioned above, and is also perhaps an example of another tendency we must note—that reigning chiefs always push their own sons at the expense of the sons of deceased chiefs. This is not a bad proceeding sometimes from the point of view of Government as it tends to foster the appointment of younger men."																															395	No	"I have dealt with the most senior son—Makasa, and how the line of all the sons of chiefs leads up to this one chieftainship. But not all sons get chieftainships as there are not enough posts to go round, so favouritism as well as ability are factors in these appointments. It does not matter whether a son is born of the head wife or of any other wife. There seems to be a vague system of training sons and discovering the more efficient ones. As the sons grow up into youths they are given sections of the chief’s village ( fitente ) to look after. Then as they pass to manhood the better ones are made village headmen. So when a chief’s appointment comes vacant there is some indication of the abilities of the sons."																															396	No	"Further study revealed that this original House-Religion had already become radically altered during the centralisation of chiefly authority and the final ascendency of the Bemba paramountcy. This had happened prior to the arrival of the missionaries, starting from around 1700 A.D. The chiefs had managed to manipulate religion to enhance their own power. The focus had shifted from the traditional House-shrine, attended by the housewife, to the court cult where the royal relics were venerated along with other magical objects. This cult had slowly acquired more power and authority than the ritual of the House-shrine, in spite of the women’s insistence on service to the immediate family spirits and to the guardians of the land."																															397	No	"Certain expressions in the Bemba language also suggest a religious imposition by the Bena Ngandu . Ever since the conquest a village had both a Mwine Mushi and a Mwine wa-Mushi (Headman). The mwine mushi was the local priest, often the son of a secondary wife and regarded as a mwine caalo (owner of the land) or shimatongwa (an original inhabitant). The Mwine wa mushi was the governor of the village, who was centrally appointed and saw to it that royal ritual was observed, for example that nobody would sow grain before the principal Mukabenye (the wife of the central Shrine) of the Paramount Chief had given the sign"																															398	No	"This religious change was an imposition, part of the Bena Ngandu overlordship. Within the villages the families kept to their religous duties of the home and there appears to have been no attempt at incorporating the main symbol of the domestic religion, the Bored Stone. However the manipulation of royal relics ( babenye ) became increasingly important and was a new element in the religious dogma of the people. These were objects of deceased paramounts, allegedly going back to the founders of the dynasty. The Paramount chief relied on his ritual powers for control. In the eyes of the people he had now control over the fertility of the land. He possessed the sacred relics of the dead chiefs and by clever distribution to senior and junior chiefs he established a hierarchy of control."																															399	No	"The oral medium is an essential factor in defining the nature and function of Bemba authority: Bufumu e busosa “The chieftainship is constituted by speech.” 1 The most compelling symbols of Bemba chieftainship-- cipuna “the royal stool,” and mupunga “fly whisk”--are applied to the oral authority’s right to speak in relation to the duty of others to listen (Corbeil IV)."																															400	No	"The kinship structure forms the framework of the Bemba political system. Authority is based on descent in the family, the village and the tribe. Power and prerogative are concentrated in the ‘lineages’ Ng’anda of a single matrilineal “clan” Mukowa or in families favored by them (Richards 1940, 85-95). There exists a vast network of family ties within the Bemba polity, which is essentially constituted and functionally characterized by the oral media of communication of authority. At every level of juridical, administrative, ritual, economic, and military power, relatives of chiefs and sub-chiefs serve as village heads, priests, advisors, messengers, et al. These are basically spokespersons and listeners--encouraging and criticizing one another, hearing and pleading cases, transmitting orders and commanding people, winning and bestowing favor, advising and discussing social affairs. The most powerful sanctions of authorities are their popularity and the sentiments of loyalty and cohesion. These in turn are fostered by the intimate knowledge and face-to-face encounters in the exercise of their power. One grows up into the fullness of authority by [Page 118] forging personal ties and demonstrating political success. In 1934 after two years of reign, Citimukulu declared, Ninkula, tukekala ku mushi nomba. Bakamfunda fyonse fya kale “I have grown up. We will stay in the village now. They will teach me everything according to the tradition” (Richards 1939, 362n)."																															401	No	"Possession of special knowledge signals a certain transcendence over one’s milieu and society. It frees the person from ordinary limits. For example, the chief’s knowledge gives him the transcendence which poetically associates him with the uncanny: “Sampa had an axe cooked up for a royal meal and Bwembya excreted feathers” (Milimo, 1978, 152). The royal wisdom frees him from the communal rules of decorum: Cikala camfumu tacitinwa “the nakedness of the chief is not to be feared” [Page 119] (Milimo 1979, 97-9). It also sets royal conduct above laws of social propriety: Bashamfumu tababa ne nsoni “chiefs have no shame” (Tanguy 1954, 17)."																															402	No	"The chief has an uncanny ontological power over his whole territory. He controls the land by his sex life and ritual leadership, “making it good, and setting it in order with his blessings” Kuwamya, Kufunga mate no kulungame calo (Richards 1939, 248). “The chief’s life cycle affects the cosmic commonweal” Ico calo nayandatila eka (Milimo 1979, 219). “His sickness disturbs the world” Ububwele bwa mfumu Litensha calo (Idem, 36). “His death destroys the political order” Mfwa ya mfumu lipenuna nsonshi (Idem), and “a period of chaotic lawlessness” Miconga intervenes (Chomba 1979, 5), signalling “the earth’s death” Calo cawa . This virtuality of the chief persuades the Bemba of their community’s cosmic integration with the permanence of rhythmic nature."																															403	No	"(123)As the oral word loses its power, the holders of knowledge produced by the oral word lose their power as well. The collapse of oral noetics undermines the credibility and feasibility of oral politics. Oral authorities, who are the transmitters and guarantors of official inspired tradition, are dislodged. At the same time, the social procedures authenticating their succession and legitimating their government are dismantled. Already in 1899 the British rulers presided over the selection and installation of senior chief Mwamba; the other major party to the dispute was the literate catholic missionaries (Roberts 1973, 283-84). By 1916 official lists of chiefs published by the British South Africa Company were the legitimating medium. In 1925 British government officials short-circuited the lengthy, disputatious, orally complicated deliberations about rival candidates’ rights and fitness for the Citimukulu, which had been traditionally carried on by the Bakabilo “councillors”. They imposed a written, fixed system for the paramount succession (Richards 1940, 100-01). Recognition by the British governor was the final criterion for chieftainship. The oral authorities, who [Page 124] were the chief spokespersons for the tradition before which there was no appeal, became the puppets of literacy or were dethroned. Their word, which formerly was the oral law, was now classified into rigid texts. These prescriptions purported to represent customary law but were modelled on British codified law (Gouldsbury 1915-16). Thus the effects, resulting from the deterioration of oral structures, were extended and intensified by colonial politics.~(122)The advent of British rule at the beginning of the twentieth century introduced new authorities, a new economy of money, wage-labor and commerce, and new government functions. These all meant new allegiances and new sanctions. In themselves, they would be enough to alter the chief’s powers and subvert the personal relationship between the chiefs and their subjects (Cf Garvey 1977). But, coupled with major changes in the communication media of English and literacy, the colonial dominance over the Bemba population was doubly decisive. For example, all along the British made documentary agreements with Bemba chiefs, based upon the trappings of English law contracts. The oral authorities, of course, did not understand that by their marks on paper, they were ceding territorial rights and resources for the pittance of manufactured goods they were given. They certainly could not have intended to disinherit their tribes and to deprive tribal posterity of land rights. The chiefs, in fact, were not so much proprietors as custodians of tribal land, which belonged to the ancestral spirits, the real “owners of the land” bene calo . To the literate colonial authorities, it was a simple quid pro quo commercial transaction documenting a transfer of real estate (Meebelo 1971, 29-31)."																															404	No	"In Bemba society the position of the chief has materially altered. One of his functions was formerly the administration of the poison ordeal ( mwafi ) to those accused of sorcery, and this gave an ultimate sense of security to the community at large. Now he no longer performs this duty, and his subjects know, moreover, that they cannot charge a witch in a legal court, black or white. ‘No one will help us now’, said an informant about the Bamucapi movement, ‘unless we help ourselves.’ It must be remembered, too, that divination, itself an [Page 459] essential part of the native system of fixing guilt, can no longer be publicly practised. It exists, but is discredited, and in this transition stage its loss has certainly robbed the native of some of his old moral certainties."																															405	No	"Briefly speaking, sex relations according to Bemba dogma make a couple ‘hot’. In this state it is dangerous for them to approach the ancestral spirits in any rite of prayer or sacrifice; and any chief or headman who attempted to perform such a ceremony without purification would run the risk of bringing disaster on his district. The chief’s shrines are guarded by old women or hereditary priests who keep sex taboos. For the chief to be casual in keeping sex taboos, or to approach his ancestors without purification is ‘to spoil the land’ ( ukuonaula icalo )."																															406	No	"(iii) Living persons who can produce good fortune by blessing ( ukupala amate ), which they do chiefly by calling on the ancestral spirits to which they have special right of address; or cursing, which they do through some less specified evil force. The blessings of a chief or a man in authority are particularly potent because of the great spirits such powerful persons have access to. The head of a matrilineage, or an important member of it can also bless in this way. A great social personage who has been injured or not given his due, is feared because he may withhold the blessings of the spirits, or actually pronounce curses ( ukutipa or ukulapishya ). The curse is specially important in relation to procreation and childbirth, since the malevolent wishes of the father’s sister can produce barrenness in the woman, or impotence in the man. This is described as ‘the great curse’. There are, however, a number of curses which can be used by injured people, who ‘throw lightning’ or are said to be able to ‘throw lions’, or who can threaten to curse, if their property is stolen, or when specially distressed by the treatment they have received."																															407	No	"This political structure has been described by me elsewhere. 13‘The Political System of the Bemba of North-Eastern Rhodesia’, in African Political Systems, edited by M. Fortes and E. E. Evans-Pritchard, 1940.It is sufficient for my present purpose to explain that all the chieftainships in Lubemba were held by members of the royal clan ( bena[unknown] nandu ). The paramount chief, the Citimukulu, traced descent through some thirty-one generations. He was chief in his own particular territory, but paramount over the whole country over which he was believed to exert supernatural powers. He also commanded the army in the old days and was head of a supreme court of appeal. He enforced his powers by inflicting brutal punishments, such as mutilation, selling into slavery, and death. He also had the right to preside over the poison ordeal which was administered to suspected witches. He was supported but also controlled by hereditary counsellors who were in charge of the chiefly ritual such as the ceremonies at the burial of all kings, princes and princesses, the rites performed at the ancestral shrines of the tribe, the care of the king’s fire and decisions over succession cases."																															408	No	The headman could command small gifts in tribute and a little service. He also had a shrine to his own personal ancestors and performed ceremonies for the good of the village. He purified the village by an act of ritual intercourse with his chief wife and his fire was regarded as the fire of the village.																															409	No	"The ideal of a Bemba in the old days was military success and with it the exaction of tribute and slaves from conquered peoples. This is arrogantly expressed in the phrase ‘We Bemba cultivate with the spear and not the hoe’. Patient industry in agriculture was not as much admired as the power to command service from others. The ability to attract followers by generosity, the elegant exchange of courtesies, and by personal popularity was highly rated. The organizing powers and judgement which are essential to the achievement of either of these aims are admired in themselves."																															410	No	"Bemba women share many of these ideals. They work for their chief in his gardens and make the same abject obeisance to him. They have a lively interest in the ritual centred in the court. They play an important part in attracting followers and kinsmen to a village. A headman’s following or ‘crowd’ ( bumba ) is attracted by means of beer, good entertainment and company, and these depend both on the successful organization of labour, which is largely a man’s job, and on the wise and tactful distribution of food, and happy personal relations, which are mainly in the women’s sphere."																															411	No	"The mistress of the ceremonies (nacimbusa) . 21The plural prefix for nouns describing persons is ‘ba’. Hence banacimbusa, or banacisungu .The nacimbusa organizes the rites, leads the dances and songs, and arranges for the making of the pottery and other emblems required. She is considered to perform a very important service. It is work that demands a detailed knowledge of ritual, industry in carrying through long and even arduous tasks, organizing ability, tact and personality. A successful nacimbusa probably has unusual intellectual ability as well as leadership and the power to attract women from surrounding villages to attend a ceremony and to keep a body of helpers alert and interested for some weeks. The nacimbusa is usually an elderly woman who has proved herself to be a successful midwife. The same terms are used for both roles. She is commonly, though not by means always, a member of the royal clan, and there is a tendency for the office to be hereditary. A nacimbusa will teach the secrets of the chisungu to her brother’s daughter, to whom she owes special obligations, and from whom she can demand service, and she may also teach them to her own daughter. But mere heredity is not enough. A young woman must build up a reputation sufficient to win the confidence of parents so that they will call her in to ‘dance their daughters’ for them. To do this she must show assiduity in attending local ceremonies and attach herself as a special helper to the nacimbusa . She must show capacity and personality, and make a name for herself as a successful midwife. I heard from one old woman that a form of initiation of young banacimbusa took place in the old days, and that they were rubbed with medicine and paid an initiation fee, but this account was not substantiated."																															412	No	"The banacimbusa are treated with great consideration by other women in the community. In the old days they were allowed to wear a feather head-dress ( ngala ), which was reserved for certain chiefs and hereditary counsellors. They were given respect at a chief’s court and have to report the carrying out of each chisungu ceremony to the chief. I am not sure whether this is still done at [Page 58] present, but Banacimbusa are rather wealthier than their fellows owing to the payments they receive, and they carry themselves with considerable dignity and circumstance."																															413	No	"Within this loose neighbourhood group the older women are honoured, not as a group of equals, but, in line with Bemba ideals, as a number of persons arranged in an exact order of precedence. This hierarchy of age and fame is constantly expressed in the ceremony. ‘The arm-pit is not higher than the shoulder’ is the song which the company sings over and over again. 73I.e. the arm-pit was created to be beneath the shoulder, and this order can never be reversed.The chief nacimbusa appears in her plumed head-dress. The mbusa are offered again and again in order of rank precedence to the older women present. They are offered kneeling, and rolling on the back as to a chief. Dances are given ‘for respect’. In fact more rites express the hierarchy of rank than any other form of symbolic behaviour in the chisungu.This is a society in which the ceremonial expression of kinship obligations is important, especially in the long process of aggregating a young husband to his wife’s village, so it is not unexpected that women should give importance to the chisungu as a centre of attraction for kinsmen. It is probable that much of the six months or so formerly given to the ceremony, was devoted to these ends. A successful and well-run ceremony attracts large crowds and contributes to the prestige of the nacimbusa and also to the village in which it is held. The dances provide an opportunity for expressing respect for status, so the nacimbusa employs the magic of attraction to make people come to her ceremony. Nangoshye explained that one of her objects in working so hard over the large models of snakes and other objects in the chisungu hut was to get the [Page 134] admiration of visitors. (See page 83.) Just as the Bemba headman tries to attract people to come and live in his village and anxiously watches to see whether he is successful in building up a community, so the nacimbusa estimates her power by the number of women of eminence who attended throughout or who appeared on visits from time to time."																															414	No	"There are, however, certain main principles of their social organization which are absolutely fundamental to an understanding of all their organized activities and forms of cooperation, and give the direction to their interests. Of these the dominant institution of the Bemba is their highly complex political system and the particularly autocratic character of the chieftainship on which it is based. Allegiance to a common Paramount—the Citimukulu—is the main tie uniting the members of a tribe that is scattered very thinly over a wide area. It determines their local grouping, and is the basis of the traditional pride of this warrior people and its distinction from neighbouring tribes. [Page 24] On a man’s relationship to his chief depends his residence, his use of land, the economic group he works with, the way in which his food is distributed, the religious and magic beliefs that sustain him in his work, and his social ambitions. Thus without understanding the political organization of the Bemba it is impossible to describe their system of food production."																															415	No	"The percentage of alcohol is probably rarely more than 4 per cent., and many of the company get very little to drink during an evening. But it must be remembered that the ubwalua is drunk hot which may increase its potency, and also that it is drunk very much less regularly than in this country. The Paramount Chief told me that a great ruler should drink beer every day without exception. Otherwise, if he drank only once or twice a week, he would become drunk like a commoner and stagger about and give bad judgements in court. ‘His chieftainship would suffer’ ( ukuti bufumu buonaule ). This was obviously in the nature of a ‘rationalization’, but it is true that chiefs who drink regularly seem to get bemused, but never violently drunk as commoners occasionally do."																															416	No	"The hospitality given to travelling chiefs must be reckoned in a different category. At the visit of the mfumu, each woman must contribute a little flour, and the headman produce chickens, the gift of honour, and, if possible, beer. But the presentation of the basket of flour and the live fowls is an act of homage, rather than mere provision for the traveller. It is brought by the headman and his elders and offered with the formal salutation of respect ( ukutota panshi )—clapping and rolling on the back on the ground—and is reckoned as part of the chief’s dues as the owner of the land (cf. Chap. XIII). But in any case it would be thought impossible to give a chief cooked food. He could not eat it because porridge cooked on ‘impure’ fire would endanger his life, 1The chief’s wife has to make new fire either by friction or with matches and sometimes to mud the floor freshly before she can prepare his food when in a strange village.and it would be considered, I think, in the nature of an insult. Chiefs visiting each other will exchange uncooked food to be prepared by their respective staffs, but only a chief’s head wife could send a royal visitor dishes of porridge and relish. All these distinctions show clearly the extent to which prestige is associated with the right to distribute food rather than its mere possession or consumption, and it is not surprising that the whole etiquette of feeding travellers is considered so important by a people constantly preoccupied with problems of status. Every traveller’s departure is followed by lengthy discussions among the women as to what he received and what he ought to have received, and the Bemba proverb, ‘Flour which is not yours is ash’ ( Bunga ubushili bwenu, mito ), can be well understood."																															417	No	"The whole institution of the kamitembo illustrates to my mind that close association between authority and the power to distribute provisions on which the tribal organization depends. The chief owns the food and receives tribute, and the chief provides for his subjects and distributes cooked food to them. Both these attributes are symbolized in the kamitembo house."																															418	No	"If, then, in the old days a man’s material possessions were no measure of his wealth, on what did his economic privileges or status in society depend, and what were the chief ambitions he pursued? Roughly speaking, the aim of every Bemba was to secure rights over the service of others, whether slaves, relatives, fellow villagers, or subjects. This would enable him to make slightly larger gardens than his fellows, or in the case of a chief, to form a band of retainers and counsellors and an army. With the economic privileges he gained through their labour were correlated political position and status. In fact the latter were considered the more important assets. The employer, if he may so be called, gained not only labour for his garden, and warriors for his army, but the prestige of a large following. ‘How did you recognize a man of rank or wealth [ umukankala ] in the old days?’ I once asked an old courtier of Citimukulu. ‘By his clothes?’ ‘No! not by his clothes. He only got cloth if the chief gave it to him from time to time. Otherwise he wore bark-cloth like every one else. You would know him by his little band of followers [ kalibumba kakwe ], his kinsmen, or the slaves he had.’ And this is a statement that can be made with equal truth of a chief to-day, of a European, or indeed any one in authority. ‘He came with a lot of people’ is a comment which is always received with respect, and I believe the fact that so many natives employed at the mines pay quite a high proportion of their wages on hiring servants is [Page 212] a reflection of this desire to build up a following. 1The need for firewood fetched at some distance from the compound is of course another factor.‘Why do you pay 5 s . a month to three boys to work for you when you only earn 60 s . yourself?’ I once asked a mine clerk. He answered simply: ‘Because I am a clerk. I am not an ordinary man.’"																															419	No	"Besides this, a prospective headman had to have the support of his chief, whether he desired to form a new village or merely to inherit the position held by one of his kinsmen. Appointment to offices such as headmanships was limited to men of senior age and descent of a lineage group or even a local branch of a clan; but of those eligible, only men who had won the favours of the chief could expect to succeed. To achieve the position of headman a man had to wait in patience, plot, plan, and try to ingratiate himself with the hospitality he offered and to impress his fellows with his mano (good sense). This aim holds good to this day, and to this purpose the ambitious man gives himself entirely, sometimes [Page 213] testing his power by settling in temporary grass huts ( imitanda ) with his closest relatives to see whether more distant kinsmen will be attracted to live with him, or going about the country assiduously visiting kinsmen. I met an old native of high family on the copper belt who had lived in the urban area ten years saving up money to buy muzzle-loading guns and attracting the nucleus of a small village group by dispensing hospitality at the mines. ‘They will go back with me,’ he said, ‘when they see I am a great man, and that they will have meat at my village.’ Once a village has been founded, the headman’s efforts cannot be relaxed, for with the Bemba practice of shifting villages, a kinship system which allows of many types of local grouping, and the Government regulations that any man with a following of nine other taxpayers can split off to form a new community, it is naturally difficult for a man to keep together a large enough following. He must still dispense food, avoid dissensions, and use magic. Otherwise at each shifting of the village people may leave him."																															420	No	"This desire to attain authority, whether over slaves, kinsmen, villagers, courtiers, or the inhabitants of a district is, therefore, the dominant factor we have to consider. The accumulation of food is entirely secondary to it, and only exists in so far as it permits the necessary concentration of service, as for instance, in the chief’s capital. Meat and beer are needed, as we saw, to feed labourers, relatives, and courtiers, and are essential to the working of the tribal machine. To give with a flourish was the glory of chieftainship, as Livingstone found when the Citimukulu of his day (Citapankwa) sent after him the ivory tusk he had sat on because he had touched it. 1Gouldsbury and Sheane, The Great Plateau of Northern Rhodesia, 1911, p. 17.Actual possession of great quantities of foodstuffs does not seem to have been a particularly cherished ambition of the Bemba. They valued a reputation for giving, not for having, and the distribution of food brought by villagers as tribute or levied as toll on the conquered peoples was a measure of wealth. Old men boast to-day about the amount the former chiefs used to take from the Bisa or surrounding peoples, and they respected a man who was able to exact the biggest levy of such tribute. I never heard a chief boast to another about the size of his granaries, but often about the amount of food brought to him and distributed by him."																															421	No	"A Bemba’s right to the use of any part of the bush depends upon his political allegiances, first to a headman and then to a chief. He cannot cultivate as an isolated individual, even though he has uncontested rights of ownership of any land he may have cleared. Every Bemba reckons himself the subject of a territorial chief. He calls himself the ‘umwina’ (subject, connexion of, member of) such-and-such a ruler, e.g. umwina Citimukulu, the subject of Citimukulu or by the historic name of the icalo itself, umwina Lubemba, an inhabitant of Lubemba. 1The word ‘umwina’ is difficult to translate. Besides the meanings given above, husband and wife refer to each other as umwina wandi, ‘the person connected with me, or with whom I am tied’, and a football team on the copper-belt uses the word for a member of the team. It must be distinguished from umwine, the owner of a thing or leader of an affair.In the first place, then, how does his status as a subject actually determine his use of land? What right has he to select in the icalo of his chief a strip of bush for a village site, or for agricultural purposes?"																															422	No	"Bemba chiefs, though they claim just as complete an overlordship over their land, do not actually allot ground for cultivation. Their own wealth they reckon in terms of the numbers of their subjects, not by the amount of land in their possession. The only district map that would be of use to them would be one showing the density distribution of the population. The Paramount Chief had the right to ‘give’ a district to one of his relatives in the old days, and he still appoints the successors to the territorial chieftainships. He may also give a village to one of his near relatives—usually a son, a daughter, or a maternal nephew—and he does so frequently even at the present day, placing his own [Page 246] nominee in a position of authority over the local group. By so doing he gives his relatives the right to command the service of their villagers however difficult it may be to exact such labour nowadays. But these royal headmen have no more power to determine the use of land than has a commoner, and probably they do not cultivate much more. To a commoner the chief merely grants permission to settle in his icalo as a member of a village community under the rule of a particular headman, and here he may choose what land he pleases. The supply is so plentiful that the question of exact distribution is not a matter of great importance. It is the political affiliation that counts. The chief looks upon a man as a subject and not as a tenant, although the status of subject does actually confer the right to use land. 1Very little has so far been published as to the position of the chief among other N. Rhodesian tribes. Among the Bisa of the Bangweolu swamps and the contiguous Baushi and Baunga, the chief seems to have no rights of allocating land, confirmed J. Coxhead: ‘The Native Tribes of N.E. Rhodesia’, F.R.A.I., Occasional papers No. 5; but among the cattle-owning tribes of the Nyasaland border (Ngoni and Cewa) and along the Kafue river (Ila)—both areas where southern influence is prominent—the chiefs claim the right to allot land for cultivation or for grazing, either directly or through the local headmen. Cf. J. Coxhead, op. cit., p. 24. Smith and Dale, 1920, op. cit., vol. i, p. 307. The same is also true of the Lamba. C. Doke, op. cit., p. 89."																															423	No	"All Bemba chiefs get food brought them whenever they travel, as do also royal princesses holding titles, and sometimes the sons, nephews, and grandsons of the royal family. Two headmen of villages on the roadside told me they were excused paying annual tribute because they had regularly to entertain their chiefs when travelling to and from the Government office at Kasama. Another headman who had given up carrying annual tribute to the capital owing to the distance, still claimed that he would bring flour, chickens, and beer to the mfumu if he heard the latter was travelling through the district. Young men at work with Europeans bring the chief no tribute in kind, but near Kasama sometimes carry him sums of money varying from 1s. to 3s. when he visits the Boma there. I saw the employees on the estate of Shiwa Dandu give the late Nkula 1s. or 2s. each when he came on tour."																															424	No	"Thus of fourteen villages in which I collected figures in 1933-4 three had sent no tribute, one having special exemption on ritual [Page 254] grounds; one fishing village had sent three carrying baskets of fish, one voluntarily and two sent for; five had sent two gourds of beer each voluntarily; two had sent one gourd of beer and one carrying basket of millet; and two were waiting to send gifts until the chief asked for them. These figures show that the due is not fixed at the present time, but that an offering of some kind or other is usually made during the year. It is important to note that the contribution is made from the village as a whole. It is as a member of a village that a man gets permission to cultivate land, and it is the community as a whole under the leadership of the appointed headman which makes the offering. To collect it the headman puts an empty basket outside his hut and calls on each housewife to make her contribution. The levy on each person would thus be little more than 2 or 3 lb. per head, or about 3d. worth at current rates."																															425	No	"The service a man owed his chief was either economic or military, that is to say, he might be employed in the cultivation of the royal gardens, clearing the roads, or building the chief’s huts, or, in the old days, he might serve as a warrior. In some cases, the service a subject owed was specified and the army or labour force was organized. In other cases, the chief had a general right to call for assistance when in need. Thus, among the Nguni group of South Africa, and in particular among the Zulu and Swazi, the tribal organization on an age-grade basis was adapted to further military ambitions, and the subjects’ service to their chief resembled a form of conscription, in which every young man of the tribe was drafted into a ‘regiment’ held in readiness to work for the king in [Page 257] his gardens, cattle kraals, village, or on the battle-field. Such an organized labour force still exists to-day in Swaziland in the amabutho or regiments of the Swazi chief. 1"																															426	No	"Among the Central Bantu, the chiefs had despotic powers over their subjects—in fact the right of life or death. 2If a family took summary revenge for a murder they had, according to Gouldsbury, to pay the chief a slave, as they had killed one of his people without permission. Cullen Gouldsbury, ‘Notes on the Customary Law of the Awemba’, Fourn. of the African Society, vol. xiv, no. liii, 1914, p. 381.They had also general claims to the service of their people in whatever way it was needed. The Bemba king was the ruler of a military tribe as was the Zulu chief, but his army was evidently less highly organized than in the case of the Southern Bantu, and it was the village that provided the military contingent, not the age-grade. Over and above this, each chief was able to exact special dues of service to be used for agricultural purposes, known by the term umulasa . Our problem, therefore, is to discover the form in which these specific dues of tribute labour are exacted and how they affect the people’s right to use the land. Is the service given in return for permission to cultivate, as the squatter on a European farm works so many months of the year in lieu of rent; or is the umulasa work given as part of a series of political dues by which a man’s allegiance to his chief is expressed?"																															427	No	"The chief must give the signal for the firing of the branches as late as possible in the dry season to give the people time to finish the work, but he must not wait till the rains have fallen [Page 295] and damped the dry wood. Territorial chiefs try to synchronize the burning in one neighbourhood, and I have seen a messenger go from Citimukulu’s court to Nkula’s village, four days’ walk away, announcing the date when the Paramount’s garden would be fired. Besides the performance of common ritual, this is the only occasion when the whole Bemba territory is organized as one economic unit."																															428	No	"European rifles are owned only by hunters employed by Europeans, or chiefs. The Bemba are said to be skilled trackers and think nothing of spending two or three days in pursuit of game. Game which is killed with a gun is the property of the shooter, to divide as he pleases, after he has given a portion to the nearest headman or chief. There is no special ritual attached to shooting, although the hunter may ask a blessing from the headman if he wishes, and in any case calls on his imipashi and carries magic charms."																															429	No	"( c ) The chief’s leadership in economic enterprises . There are two aspects of the chief’s functions as an organizer of labour. In the first place, there are a number of activities he actually initiates and co-ordinates, and in the second, his direction of his own labour force and his accumulation of stores in the capital, sets the pace for agricultural enterprise and forms the basis of the whole economic system of the tribe."																															430	No	"Besides, it is difficult to realize, without living at the capital for some time, the extent to which the mfumu directs agricultural enterprises by advising or criticizing both the members of his own big village and those of his icalo . Ultimately chiefs want food produced in their district, because they then get plenty of tribute. They express this fact quite frankly. A severe shortage also, as I indicated, reflects on their supernatural powers, makes people begin to grumble, and even in time threaten to leave. 3e.g. the charges made all over the country against Citimukulu during the recent locust epidemic for failure to perform his ritual duties properly.From all points of view, therefore, it is to the chief’s advantage that the people should cultivate efficiently. Their knowledge of cultivating processes, soil selection, and the best moment for planting is also [Page 387] considerable. Even the most stupid or beer-sodden rulers seemed to discuss such matters with authority. The chief always selects his own site for tree-cutting in my experience. I have seen Citimukulu and Lucembe advise women as to whether their millet was ripe enough to reap, and Nkula upbraiding some of his people on two occasions, once for making village beds on unsuitable soil, and at another time for not fencing properly. He turned to me with a look as despairing as that of any white educator, and said: Look at them! They are working anyhow ( cibombebombe ). Is not that what hunger does?’ 1"																															431	No	"Of their icalo as a whole the chiefs also know a great deal. The messengers who go about from village to village to fetch tribute labourers, or the headmen who come on business to the capital, report on conditions. I was amazed in fact to find how much of the conversation in a chief’s hut concerned the whole organization of the food-supply, the exact type of soil in such and such a place, or the methods successfully used on it. Comments and criticisms are passed freely. The chief also knows when and where the rivers are in flood, and, in an incredibly short time, how many buck any travelling European has hit or missed. Thus his position at the capital, a place where people constantly come and go, his specialized knowledge of agriculture, and his personal interest in food-production, the latter at present correlated with the whole tribute system, gives the Bemba ruler opportunity to lead and influence the agricultural activities of the whole tribe. This fact may well acquire administrative importance if any new improved system of cultivation is ever discovered for this area."																															432	No	"Women of the royal line, the mothers, sisters, maternal nieces, and granddaughters of the chiefs are called banamfumu and are treated with much the same deference as are the men of the family. The mother of the paramount is highly honoured, succeeds to a fixed title—the Candamukulu —takes part in tribal councils, and has several villages of her own. The sisters of chiefs are privileged persons, protected and supported by their royal brothers, and usually granted one or more villages to rule. They are above the law in matters of sex morality, and a princess is allowed to have as many lovers as she pleases, provided she produces many children as potential heirs to the throne."																															433	No	"The positions of leadership in Bemba society consist of the following offices: ( a ) territorial rulers (chiefs and headmen); ( b ) administrative officers and councillors; ( c ) priests, guardians of sacred shrines, and magic specialists with economic functions; ( d ) army leaders in the old days. Succession to all these offices is [Page 96] based on descent in nearly every case. Chieftainships were limited to one clan, as we have seen; some of the councillorships (i.e. the bakabilo ) are confined to a few of the older clans; and headmanships, though they may be won through the chiefs favour, tend to become hereditary in their turn. All priestly offices are hereditary without exception, as is natural where an ancestral cult of this type is practised. Magico-economic specialists, particularly those in charge of fishing villages, usually acquire their powers by descent also, as do some of the doctors and diviners ( nanga ). In each case the supernatural powers almost invariably correlated with political authority in this area are conferred by a rite, of great complexity, in the case of the succession of a chief, known as ukupyanika . For these reasons it is essential to study the dogma of descent by which these powers are believed to be transferred from one generation to another, and the legal rules of succession by which status and office are passed from one man to another."																															434	No	"The functions of the territorial heads, i.e. chiefs and headmen, seem to be derived from two sources—the position of the leader as head of a kinship group and his role as the representative of a line of dead ancestors in a particular district. In the case of a headman, these two aspects are indistinguishable, while the latter predominates where a chief is concerned."																															435	No	"(b) The Chief . The functions of the different types of chief [Page 105] differ only in degree. All are said to look after their people, to ‘work the land’, and, with reference to their supernatural powers, to ‘spit blessings over the land’ ( ukufunga mate ). Their political duties consist in the administration of their capitals and also of their territories as a whole. A large umusumba means plenty of coming and going, enough workers for joint enterprises, a large panel of advisers for court cases, many messengers to keep in touch with the surrounding villages—in short, the possibility of keeping the tribal machine running. To maintain and even augment such a community by his popularity and his reputation for generosity is one of the chief’s important political tasks. He has also to keep contact with the people widely dispersed over his icalo and to appoint new headmen, amalgamate old villages, and decide as to the selection of heirs to old titles. On his success in these last duties the integration of his people as a political unit largely depends."																															436	No	"The sanctions for a chief’s authority are numerous, and they were still greater in the old days. The most important of these has already been described as the people’s belief in their rulers descent from a long line of ancestors and the supernatural powers thought to be so conferred. Besides this, a reputation for generosity and a system by which advancement could only be attained through royal favour naturally bound people to him. Much of his power also rested in the old days on force. A chief practised savage mutilations on those who offended him, injured his interests, laughed at him or members of his family, or stole his wives. A number of these mutilated men and women still survive in Bemba country to-day. Command over the army and over the supply of guns also lay in the chief’s hands and there is no doubt that the greatness of the Bena nandu rested to a large extent on fear. The people explain that the royal family were named after the crocodile because ‘they are like crocodiles that seize hold of the common people and tear them to bits with their teeth’."																															437	No	"Besides these new authorities introduced into the political arena, the power of the Bemba chief is inevitably reduced by his economic position, which must have grown increasingly bad since the first days of European occupation. The Bemba rulers were never rich compared to a number of African potentates. Theirs is a poor country. They possess no cattle which could be converted to money under modern conditions; the ivory of their country no longer belongs to them, nor their mineral rights. Land has no financial value as yet, and the salaries given to chiefs have always been low compared to the income, say, of the paramount chief of the Barotse. 1The Barotse chief receives an annual subsidy of £1,700, together with £850 from the British South Africa Company and £1,500 from the Zambesi saw-mills, as compared to the £60 a year of the Bemba paramount.Added to this, the service on which the Bemba chiefs depended is cut down by half or more by the absence of men at the mines, and what remains is often given unwillingly. These chiefs never apparently exacted court fines as a regular thing, after the fashion of the cattle-owning Bantu, and have not yet put a levy on the earnings of men away at the mines, as has been done in some parts of South Africa."																															438	No	"Many mounds belonged to the king. On some of these he settled his wives and children or siblings, and he would give to them followers who would be granted land attached to the mound. Others were his gardens, worked by the people of the neighbourhood and, especially after he abandoned his right to tribute labour, by servants. Yet other mounds he gave or lent to commoners. He might settle a family, or a number of unrelated families, at a mound with no special duties; or he might [Page 31] devolve on them certain of his economic works, such as caring for his gardens or one of his herds, for a fishing-site, bird-reserve, or a lake in which turtles were bred. At royal-graves (below, pp. 34-5) the work was to care for the grave, present offerings and herd the grave's cattle, whose products the caretakers could use. These people lived off the gardens and fishing-sites of the king's mounds. These were all ‘homesteads of the king’ but their occupants paid no special tribute, though they were usually men who had served, and voluntarily continued to work for, the king. They gave more generously of their surpluses than other Lozi to the king."																															439	No	"Furthermore, for the king, as for commoner-headmen, idle land was useless. If the king settled all his land he got workers and loyal followers, and in addition it was in fact bad for his reputation to hold unused land, since Lozi looked askance on it, owing to the scarcity of land. The [Page 32] people of his homesteads, like all Lozi, brought him gifts of fish and food but in greater quantities. They depended on him to stabilise their tenure, and increase their land so that they could themselves get followers. The king would place men under a good and loyal headman and the acquisition of land, and therefore of followers, was the chief road to political promotion. Thus the king and his subjects were in the same reciprocal position as a commoner-headman and his dependants. The king needed labour and loyal subjects, his subjects wanted land. The king had many servants (mostly prisoners-of-war) but he also got his work done by appointing men to his homesteads and giving them land. Lozi on his land were greatly dependent on him and there was strong pressure on them to be loyal to him. People were not able to quarrel with the king as with a commoner relative."																															440	No	"Nevertheless the Lozi use of margin-land weakened the control of headmen, i.e. mound-owners, to some extent. First, it increased the area of possible settlement so that it was easier for dissatisfied dependants to find land elsewhere. Second, and more important, it increased the labour problems of the landowner who had both mid-plain and margin land, if he were to make full use of his resources.[unknown] lands and resources and therefore his labour needs, were more widely distributed and he required still more people to live with him and aid his work. That is, in the balance of control of land against need for working dependants, the weight of the latter was increased. It was at this period of Lozi settlement of margin-land that King Lewanika brought many provincials to work for him in Loziland, and that in his campaigns against Ila, Subya and Lubale many prisoners-of-war were brought to become workers for the Lozi."																															441	No	"Nevertheless, this early entry of trade-goods did not at once radically alter the balance of the economy. The dominant position of the Lozi, and especially of the Lozi king, was further validated, since the new commodities, of which they largely had a monopoly, were eagerly desired. But the king could not yet invest, except in his relations with his people, and though Lewanika and his family could have better clothes, houses built by the Mambali, a wagon and tools, they could not consume all the goods. The Lozi king distributed trade-goods not only to his Lozi followers but also to the subject tribes"																															442	No	"Today, the king has lost the power to move people, and most areas near the plain have been allocated. But newcomers, especially immigrants from Angola, are settled in an area in the bush only with his consent, though he consults the local important people. These newcomers either approach the king through the head of the area in which they want to settle, or are sent to a particular area after going directly to the king to make allegiance. The headman, at the king's request (and he can protest that his area is full), will settle them at a particular site and allocate them garden land in his own or a subordinate's land. This land then becomes their own."																															443	No	"In the new conditions what happens to the chief's relations with his subjects? In Loziland, the paramount has for many years had sufficient money income from various sources to purchase luxuries brought by European trade. More and more he has done so, while the people grumble increasingly that he is not as generous as his predecessors; it is reported that some have even complained on occasions that the royal family spends money lavishly while the mass of commoners live in poverty."																															444	No	"(a) In the dry season, Lozi owners of shallow pans, where the waters have fallen summon as many people as possible to stab for fish, or catch fish with baskets, in the pan. On the first day only, and provided that he has not previously fished there himself, the owner of the pan is entitled to take a fixed proportion of every man's catch: none of 1 or 2 fish, 1 of 3 or 4, 2 of 5 or 6, 3 of 7 or 8, and so on. He cannot [Page 73] exceed this proportion and he cannot take of the catch of the attendants of the chief or the prime minister, or certain big headmen. The king is entitled to a similar proportion of all fish stabbed in his pans: his councillors collect this, and if they exceed the proportion fixed by custom, the stabber can sue them."																															445	No	"In the old days only the king, his wives and children, and the princess chief, could by right wear ivery bracelets but the king would permit his collateral relatives and his important councillors and their wives to do so. The hunter and his family wore bracelets of the red skin from the elephant's feet to show his courage. The meat belonged to the hunter, but he had to bring the neekl one, the tail, and the tip of the trunk to the king. About 1000 Lewanika gave the hunter and his family the right to wear ivory bracelets."																															446	No	"In 1929 the Lozi court wrote down a number of their laws. No. 12 states: “All elephants in the country are the exclusive property of the Paramount Chief, any hunter wishing to shoot an elephant must first get permission from the Paramount Chief. The hunter may not sell or deal with the tusks, whether of one or more elephants, but should bring the tusks to the Paramount Chief who will compensate as he thinks fit. The penalty for breaking this law will be a fine not exceeding [unknown]50.” An important councillor of the Mavinga Lozi kuta who stole ten tusks was fined ten oven (at that time priced at[unknown] 3 a head)."																															447	No	"The right of the royal family to the kingship is unquestioned; no Lozi commoner can think of himself taking the throne. At the selection of a new king, or during a rebellion, the actual contenders for power may be councillors or groups of councillors. Always they have served their interests by supporting a particular prince. When a group of councillors mutinied against a king, because of his own policy or because he favoured another group of councillors, they attacked neither the kingship itself nor the rights of the royal family to it. Each party put forward its royal candidate for the throne and fought in his name. Thus when the councillors Mataa and Numwa drove out King Lewanika in 1884, they installed Prince Akufuna Tatila as king. Lewanika returned with an army and drove them out in turn. Mataa fled to the north, to the kingdom in the Lukwakwa where some Lozi had taken refuge from the Kololo. He persuaded the ruler there, Sikufele, to return as his leader to fight for the Lozi throne. It is clear that commoner councillors could only seek for power by serving their own royal candidate for the kingship."																															448	No	"A royal village may have attached to it a number of other villages whose headmen in ranked order form a council ‘to look after’, ‘to care for’, the royal incumbent or title-holder: his village, gardens, fishing, personal affairs, &c. But often the royal village has among its adherents other villages many miles away and in flood-season its villagers near by may move away, while other people, living at a distance, settle for a time near to it. In addition, in the administrative organization the villagers have allegiance to other princes and title-holders. Villages in one small local area may be attached to different royal villages in that neighbourhood. But affairs [Page 30] affecting land in the neighbourhood of a royal village should properly come to it, and there is a feeling that other disputes among people in the neighbourhood should come to it, though they are not properly in its jurisdiction. Therefore there are frequent disputes between princes and councillor title-holders over their commoner followers and between them and commoners about the allegiance of the latter. Commoners also dispute about the relative status of the royal villages to which they are attached, since by different criteria a royal grave, the village of a powerful prince, the village of an important council-title, and the capital of an old king can each be considered superior to the others. At this level then Lozi political structure shows a large number of competitively orientated small groups which are in some ways localized and in others consist of attached but scattered villages, all of which have other attachments; and the composition of the groups varies between flood and dry seasons."																															449	No	"Rank--the relationship of lord ( mulena ) and underling ( mutanga ); of parent ( mushemi ) and child ( mwana ); of warden or owner ( mung'a ) and a person ( mutu ) or thing ( nto )--is implicit in every Lozi relationship. Each of these three types of relationship, these three kinds of ranking, is contained in the others. The parent is lord over his child and owns him; the husband is lord over his wife and owns her; the king is parent of his followers and owns them. But the Lozi also think of these relationships as reversible. The child is lord over his parent and the wife is ‘another kind of lord’ to her husband. The king is not only the child of the nation but he is also its mutanga , its serf, its servitor. ‘Chieftainship is slavery’, say the Lozi, like the Ila. When Lozi reported to me King Imwiko's accession speech, they all recalled several times his saying: ‘You have chosen me, you have killed me.’"																															450	No	"Since there were no cleavages of class, based on economic interests, in Barotse society to be represented by mats or sub-councils, we may say that these various internal intersecting divisions of the national council exist autonomously in the political structure. Moreover, in Loziland the powerful councillors do not represent territorial segments which have a corporate identity within the kingdom. The councillors are powerful only in virtue of their offices, the positions of their titles on the council, and in virtue of their recognition by the council and king, and not because they lead bands of followers, even though having followers is a path to promotion. Thus, though the Lozi council was, and is, intricately organized into ‘mats’, sub-councils, and sets of titles heading sectors, which are held to represent various components of the state, they do not in fact represent organized groups."																															451	No	"The king had in the capital for his service an organized group of warriors who could exercise force: his privileged mabuto . But it was a small force, available also to the council by the king's permission. For, as we have seen, though in this system of checking and counterbalancing administrative units the king was specifically represented by certain units, yet he stood above them all. It is held that the king can do no injustice, and should a commoner feel that he is unjustly affected by an action of the king's he can sue the councillor or attendant who carried it out. The king never acts: ‘he is not a policeman’. [Page 54] For a ruler or councillor or headman to take violent action is a heinous offence, for which he may be discharged. Even a king has been threatened with deposition 1In the past usually possible only by a rebellion.for doing this. The ruler is ideally wise, gentle, and soft-tempered; for ‘the anger of a chief kills’."																															452	No	"Kingship thus consists in having many subjects, distributing land, [Page 55] possessing ritual power, holding emblems, receiving ceremonial attention, and in exercising organized power through an elaborate structure of officials. For the Lozi, as a nation, there are these three autonomous but in terpenetrating elements in their political structure: the kingship as such, which is the epitome of the concepts of rank which enter into all their relationships; the administrative organization which embraces everyone and which works through its junction in the king; and the land which belongs to the king. These elements are all reflected in the cult of the royal graves. The royal spirits had in them the virtue and power of kingship to affect the whole nation, the royal family, the land, and the fortunes of any subject. These graves are not only of kings and princess chiefs, but also of princes and princesses who had been given people. The virtue of kingship is in the royal family as a whole. Two queens have royal graves because they helped their husbands. They link royal family and commoners who constantly intermarry: the royal family is not completely isolated from commoners. The graves are worked in the sector system, for almost all royal graves are of kings with sectors or princes and princesses who were given sub-sectors. The spirit can affect anyone, but particularly a member of its sector, for it ‘knows’ him. Finally, each grave has immediate power over its immediate neighbourhood, in relation to local dispositions of the people; and yet it also has undivided power over all Loziland."																															453	No	"The king may give a piece of land to an individual, but in practice all land is held by villages in the names of their village headmen. Even when an individual is given land by the king, his title to it accrues to his position in a village. The pattern of Lozi land-holding is the attachment of numerous small, distributed, and intermingled gardens and fishing-sites to specific villages, either of titles or of families. The Lozi emphasize strongly laws which prevent a man from ‘taking land from one village to another’. If a man leaves a village he loses his rights in all land which he worked as a member of that village; and though a man may work land at his mother's home while living in his father's, or vice versa, he cannot move the title to the land to his village of residence. He works the land by grace of the headman to whom it is attached."																															454	No	"Lozi family villages are inhabited by groups of cognates related to the headmen and to each other in a variable pattern. Almost all inhabitants of such a village are kindred, with their wives, and in the past serfs, who were adopted as kinsmen, though with lesser rights. The Lozi have a bias to father-right, but in practice a man can claim the right to settle in the village of any of his ancestors. The courts protect the rights of people in the villages and land of their maternal kindred, though Loz[unknown]i say: ‘Why do you claim land at your mother's? Claim at your father's.’ The heir to a headman is selected from any of a man's kindred for his ability to hold the village together. Preference is given to his brothers and sons, but a son of a junior wife or the younger son of a particular wife may be chosen and often a uterine nephew or grandson is selected."																															455	No	"The network of links by which a man is attached to the king through councillors and stewards is intricate, but it usually originates in his headman, who occupies a crucial position in interlocking the political and kinship systems."																															456	No	"Life is lived through a series of highly variable situations, and the judges have to assess whether the parties have abided by customary norms as reasonably applied to each situation. Hence the concept of reasonable behaviour is to some extent variable, and ‘reasonable and customary’ are standards applied in combination to establish the truth in crossexamination and to assess substantive rights in judgment. Here ‘reasonable’ measures conformity in degree of performance of duty (liabilities) and exercise of rights (privileges and powers). Rules such as that which says a headman must be generous are [Page 157] tested by what he has done, and again custom lays down standards. Correspondingly, since a man's respect for his seniors is partly measured by the gifts he gives them of fish and other necessities, or of help in work, these have to be assessed in relation to his age, strength, skill, wealth, and overall obligations to others (see ‘The Case of the Good Son-in-Law’). A man may have different demands on his goods or skill: he must keep a balance between them."																															457	No	"The method by which a man rose to the position of headman was not clear cut. It was by ‘flexible descent’ within the resident kin, for which the image of election is too precise, for seniority and proximity to the previous headman were important although not irresistible determinants. The flexibility ensured that common sense overruled anomaly in the procedure of selection so that half-wits and people considered to be undesirable could be passed over."																															458	No	"Headmen would appear to lack this respect and protection. An examination of the data provides some interesting points, for while, for most practices, the percentage of headmen accused ranges between 12 per cent and 17 per cent, for some practices it is much higher.Headmen are usually still in their prime and still receiving a good share of the food coming into the village. It is to be expected, therefore, that few charges of necrophagy should have been made against them, especially since, as will be shown later, victims are usually the close kin of the necrophager, and since a headman is very dependent upon such kin for support in the village. In fact, of the 61 cases of necrophagy only one concerns a headman.Of case records of witchcraft and sorcery ( balos ) 10 per cent relate to headmen. This is at first sight an average return. When one considers only male accused, however, the proportion rises to 22 per cent. Accusations of sorcery often reflect tensions and hostility that have grown from non-magical causes. It is reasonable to suppose that accusations against headmen often result from conflicts over land and authority, and provide the excuse for a member or section of his village to break away. The headman may also try to frighten his opponents by claiming magical powers or even try to destroy them with sorcery."																															459	No	"Again, headmen are the accused in 21 of the 92 cases of weather control. This high proportion probably stems from the desire that must be present in almost every headman to protect his village and its inhabitants from harm. If at the same time his prestige is increased, this is an added benefit. Conversely, a man who is able to drive away lightning and to call up rain when required, is much more likely to attract and keep adherents to his new village. There is insufficient data in the case records to separate raindoctors, who control the elements, from laymen, who merely drive away lightning from their own villages or call rain to them. One wonders, however, to which group these headmen belong. A man who is reputed to be able to direct lightning to or withhold rain from a specific place, is likely to make enemies as well as friends. The few indications that exist in the records suggest that such a man does not usually become a headman. The data on this point is, however, inadequate for any firm conclusions to be drawn."																															460	No	"Of the 96 diviners using divining baskets, 22 were headmen. It is perhaps reasonable to suppose that the qualities required of a successful headman are similar to those required of a basket diviner. Both demand skill and some intelligence, as well as personality and the ability to catch and to hold the attention and confidence of others. Other divining devices that are but ‘gimmicks’ to gain popular interest do not require all of these and, as far as intelligence is concerned, may even require the opposite."																															461	No	"Secondly, while the Akan vested the right of succession in the royal matrilineage, they left open the question of the actual successor among the eligible males, which was resolved by joint consultations between the ohemma, as leader of the royal matrilineage, and the members of the village, divisional, or national council. In the process of consultation the ohemma and the council were governed by the following rules: brothers should succeed each other before sisters' sons in the order of seniority in age; but age could be discounted in favour of superior wisdom and character in a junior person. Seniority in age could also be discounted in favour of a younger successor, if rotational succession among the segments of the royal lineage had been adopted as a ‘convention’ by the lineage and the community as a whole. Where rotation had been adopted as a working rule, both the male and female stools rotated among the segments, so that at any moment the occupants belonged to different competing segments."																															462	No	"Women and adolescent girls were normally camp-followers and performed commissariat duties. Royal females of Kumasi accompanied the Asantehene, Osei Yaw Akoto (1823–34), at the Battle of Dodowa in 1826, when the Asante pitched their national shrine, the Golden (the paramount Asante) Stool, against combined southern Akan and Ga-Adanme forces led by British officers. It appears from the events following the war that women were generally desired as hostages."																															463	No	"They had a recognized leader or spokesman, the Nkwankwaahene. 1 He was not a member of the chief's official council, and his office was not a hereditary one. The commoners chose any one of themselves whom they considered brave and eloquent. When so chosen he became a recognized leader, and the commoners would submit their disputes to be settled by him in arbitration, and on any question of importance he presented the views of the young men to the elders."																															464	No	"Before 1900, when there were tribal wars, the military duty of the chief and the elders was important. They led different sections of the army. The military formation of Wenchi conformed to the type common to all Ashanti. 11 See Rattray, Ashanti Law and Constitution, chaps. xvi-xxiii.It consisted of scouts ( akwansrafo), and an advance guard ( twafo) in front, followed by the main body [Page 14] ( ad[unavailable]nten and konti), the chief's body-guard ( gyase), a rearguard ( kyid[unavailable]m) with the right- ( nifa) and left- ( benkum) wing flanks.Each section was under the leadership of an elder. The chief commanded the whole army."																															465	No	"Chiefship in Ashanti is a sacred office. This has been shown by the rites of the chief's enstoolment and by his part in ceremonies such as have been described. As long as he sits upon the stool of [Page 37] the ancestors his person is sacred. As the successor of the ancestors he performed various rites for the welfare of his people. With that office were joined other functions which may be described as administrative, executive, judicial, and military. If he abused his power, he was divested of it by having his special connexion with his ancestors, established on his enstoolment, severed. This happened when he committed or was made to commit one of the tabooed acts. His sanctity was violated and he was no longer able to sit on the stool of the ancestors. Thus, the Ashanti destool a chief by bumping his buttocks on the ground, or taking his sandals off his feet, or by mutilating his body. After such an act the chief was no longer in special contact with the ancestors, and having lost his sanctity he became automatically divested of all the other functions pertaining to the office of chiefship."																															466	No	"Although there are constitutional checks for the proper exercise of the chief's powers, the office is essentially sacred. Ancestor-worship is based on the lineage system, the members of a lineage forming a cult-group in relation to their own ancestors. The tribe as a whole is a cult-group in relation to the chief's ancestors.In the ritual, as in the constitutional aspect of his life, the chief is the focus of the unity of the tribe. His ritual functions are connected with ceremonies through which the people express their reverence for the ancestors and gods and their sense of dependence on them, and also their sentiments of solidarity and continuity. This accounts for the persistence of the ritual ceremonies in the face of revolutionary changes in the political system. The chief's position is bound up with strong religious sentiments."																															467	No	"The head of the lineage who inherited the land was one of the chief's elders. Every elder was under an obligation to assist the chief to defend the land. On becoming an elder a man took an oath of allegiance to his chief. 11 Cf. Rattray, Ashanti, p. 225.‘As you have put me on this stool, if I do not render you good service, if I do not give you good help to rule this people, if I tell you any falsehood whatsoever, I swear the oath, then may the Sky and the Earth “get” me (i.e. harm me).’"																															468	No	"Although they retained possession of their lands, the Divisional chiefs incurred obligations to the Asantehene. They were obliged to attend the periodic Odwera ceremonies held in Kumasi, and they brought gifts of food and meat to the Asantehene on these occasions. They accepted limitations on their judicial powers, and death sentences were authorized by the Asantehene only."																															469	No	"Under these Abirempon were the Adekurofo (headmen) in charge of the various villages. Each village consisted of a number of lineages which formed a local political unit. The Odekuro was selected from one of the lineages as head of the village. He became its official representative or spokesman through whom the elder, or the chief, if the village came directly under him, transmitted his orders. He and the heads of the other lineages that formed his council discussed and managed the affairs of the village."																															470	No	"Sometimes an urgent order was made asking the subjects of a chief to perform a service. One such instance occurred in 1920 when a chief was fined £25 by the District Commissioner because he had not cleared his road. He was allowed three days in which to have the work completed. There were about ten miles of road to be cleared. The chief caused a gong to be beaten, declaring that all his men should turn out, and that anyone who failed to do so was guilty of the oath Yaora (Thursday). Anyone who disobeyed such an order offended the ancestors whose oath had been used."																															471	No	"Examples may be given of other occasions on which the oath was used for various other purposes:(i) Captains going to war swore that they would never turn their back to the enemy. In Ashanti, the penalty for transgressing this oath was death.(ii) A captain swore an oath ordering that none of his men should retreat from an enemy.(iii) A chief might swear an oath enjoining his men to observe a certain custom.[Page 78](iv) A chief or an elder might swear an oath ordering all present to assist in quenching a fire.(v) A man might swear an oath to restrain others from stealing crops from his farm.(vi) A man might swear an oath to prevent another from doing him bodily harm.(vii) A chief might swear an oath ordering the cleaning of the path to the village stream.(viii) A chief might swear an oath ordering all his men to help in the search for or apprehension of a murderer.(ix) A chief might swear an oath asking his men to rescue the dead or dying from a fallen house or tree.(x) A chief might enforce the accepted rules of conduct by oath, e.g. restraining young women from loose sexual morality or young men from riotous living.(xi) A man might swear an oath to retrieve his lost property from another.(xii) On the dissolution of a marriage a divorced husband may swear an oath restraining his divorced wife from associating with a paramour suspected to have been instrumental in disrupting the marriage."																															472	No	"Although the formation of the Union was impelled by the need for common defence, no permanent Union Army was established. The constituent States supplied the men required for defence or external aggression as the need arose. All able-bodied men of each State were liable for military service, and their chief was responsible for providing them with powder and ammunition. For a major war the Asantehene collected the necessary powder and ammunition together. Sometimes this took several years, as the powder and ammunition were purchased from the coast and carried to Kumasi. When he had collected enough the Asantehene distributed it to the chiefs, who paid for it by a levy on their own people. This was the war tax ( apea-to[unavailable]).As it was the chiefs who provided the fighting men, they were consulted in all matters relating to war and their consent was gained for every action. Foreign policy was the joint responsibility of all the chiefs. Bowdich found that his mission was protracted because the chiefs were called together from the different States to consider every proposal he put before the Asantehene. At such meetings each chief had an equal voice, and the weight of his [Page 90] opinion depended on his rank and status rather than on the size of his State."																															473	No	"We have shown that in the other States the military organization was built up on the lineage system. In war each elder was the leader of his lineage, which fought in the front, rear, centre, wing, or main body according to its traditional place in the military organization."																															474	No	"The cardinal principle of the Ashanti Constitution—that those who elected a chief could also depose him—applied to the Asantehene also. Not only were the electors particular in electing a suitable man, but they were also particular that he should rule constitutionally. Again the history of Ashanti in the latter half of the nineteenth century provides examples. 1In 1874 Kofi Kakari, then Asantehene, took some gold trinkets and other valuable treasures from the royal mausoleum at Bantama. He did not consult his councillors in Kumasi or the chiefs about this. It might have been permitted in a case of national peril, but only with the consent of the Kumasi councillors and the chiefs of the Union. When the action was discovered, the chiefs of Juaben, Nsuta, Bekwai, and Kokofu joined the Kumasi councillors in denouncing it as unconstitutional and sacrilegious, and Kakari was deposed."																															475	No	"His successor, Mensa Bonsu, became unpopular, for in his effort to replenish the royal exchequer he imposed heavy fines on his people for trifling offences. It was even suspected that he designedly got his rich subjects into trouble so that he might fine them heavily. At this time it was found out that he had had an intrigue with the wife of the Kontihene's brother. This was one of the things a chief was admonished on his enstoolment not to do. The unconstitutional act, and the fact that the people were dissatisfied with his extortionate rule, caused a rebellion against him and he fled from Kumasi."																															476	No	"In 1915 the commoners of Kumawu rebelled against the chief. One of the reasons for this was that the chief had kept for himself money which had been collected for the War Fund. This was found to be true on investigation, but Government retained the chief on the stool. He was made to refund all the money he had collected and pay a personal contribution to the War Fund. The Chief Commissioner who settled this matter reported: ‘The youngmen of this Division have become rich through their cocoa farms, [Page 108] and are of a rather turbulent nature.’ 11 Colonial Reports: Ashanti, 1915.The following year the commoners again rebelled against their chief, and this time he was destooled. The Chief Commissioner, recording the destoolment in the Annual Report for 1916, explained: ‘Kwame Afram, Omanhene of Kumawu was destooled. He had become tyrannical and harsh in his conduct towards his subjects, and the only solution of the difficulty was destoolment.’"																															477	No	"This is relevant in considering the position of the chief in Ashanti to-day. As has been shown, the Ashanti military organization has been preserved in the political organization. The military exploits of their ancestors are still the basis for determining rank and prestige among the chiefs.Before the British Administration the chief was the military leader of his people. This enhanced his prestige and importance. He is no longer the military leader, and the people do not look to [Page 112] him for defence, but to the Government. This means for the chief the loss of some prestige and authority."																															478	No	"IN the preceding chapters we have examined the various duties of the chief, and the institutions through which he functions. The Ashanti chief thinks of himself and is regarded by his people primarily as ‘he who sits upon the stool of the ancestors’. He is accorded reverence as the successor of his royal ancestors, to whom he performs sacrifices on behalf of the tribe. He is custodian of the tribal land, because the people regard the land as belonging to the ancestors. His judicial functions are exercised in connexion with offences which are religious and threaten the relationship between the community and the ancestors of the chief and the gods."																															479	No	"The loss of economic resources and the fact of stool debts arising principally from litigation about land have not only deprived the chief of his traditional role as a repository of wealth and bestower of largesse, and so of an important sanction of his authority, but have also created a state of mutual suspicion and fear between chief and subject. Owing to such a situation a chief's activities are always suspect, and the community readily believes stories of misappropriation or dishonesty, and succumbs to any move to destool him."																															480	No	"Coastal chiefs taxed farmers heavily so they could buy food for these mercenary guardsmen and pay other officials, which forced farmers to intensify food production for urban sale. Inland governments used slaves not as soldiers, but to produce food and trade goods for official supplies and for sale to compensate for the reduction in revenues collected from free citizens, who now contributed mainly military service, labor, and produce in kind. Wealthy merchants also invested in slaves for production of food for sale in towns and for the production of gold, salt, and other commodities for long-distance trade. The new states controlled trade more tightly, participated in it more directly, and taxed it more heavily because their increasing militarization made them depend on these measures for cash income. Since free citizens now marketed less of their fresh produce, they could live farther from the towns and settle a broader territory under central control (Kea 1982). This enabled Asante villages to spread out into a vast territory only sparsely settled before."																															481	No	"Asante chiefs intervened to promote, control, or subsidize commerce in three ways. First, the Asantehene and other senior chiefs employed people to trade on their behalf. These state traders, called batafo, purchased official requirements, such as cloth, slaves, and gunpowder (Lewin 1974; Wilks 1975). They also conducted general commerce for state profit, with state funds. War captives were sold by state traders or distributed to leading figures in the campaign for resale on the coast or local employment. Slaves also traded for their masters or mistresses, including some of the ahemma, or female chiefs, and some female slaves (McCaskie 1980b). Second, chiefs loaned out state funds to prominent citizens. The recipient traded with them, either directly or through subordinates, and the resulting wealth added to the glory of the state and potential sources for forced loans (Wilks 1975).Asante chiefs also controlled benefits from private commerce by regulating it. Through border controls, the Asantehene taxed traders, reserved guns and powder to the state, and restricted the passage of aliens. Subordinate chiefs appointed officials to settle disputes and supervise price bargaining in local and border markets. They also declared boycotts and embargoes in political or commercial disputes with neighboring towns or chiefdoms (Brown 1972; Wilks 1975; Akoto 1980)."																															482	No	"The leaders of the organized women's commodity groups in Kumasi Central Market have the most structural potential for coordinating and exercising the diverse strengths that market women draw on from ethnic, gender, and community connections as well as their commercial positions. These groups are the most cohesive collegial sets within Kumasi Central Market and thus provide something of a test case for the efficacy of collegial relations. As leaders of those groups, they can call on the collective support of their members but are sometimes accused of manipulating members' loyalty for personal financial gain at their expense. Since their authority turns out to be based on rendering services in dispute settlement and negotiations, services that can only be effective in full support of the members' interests and with substantial consensus, a strong argument can be made that this exploitative potential either does not exist or has not been realized."																															483	No	"The loyalty and discipline that give leaders their effective power derive from their presiding role in internal dispute settlement. Group members value this service highly as being essential to long-term efficiency in market transactions. Dispute settlement often appears in the [Page 249] historical and ethnographic record as a key aspect of organization for traders or urban residents. Medieval European cloth merchants began to develop bourgeois institutions of town government at fairs, where they needed speedy dispute settlement outside of the feudal courts. Zairian smugglers set up informal tribunals in remote border regions to regulate their illegal activities (MacGaffey 1991). Yoruba women traders in small towns and villages have leaders who settle disputes, even where more elaborate functions have not developed (Sudarkasa 1973; Trager 1976). In Ghana, Cape Coast market association members and leaders both agree that commodity queens have been needed as long as there were disputes between market traders (Amonoo 1974). Routine disputes also hone Kumasi market leaders' skills of argument and negotiation on a daily basis. These were taxed to the full in external negotiations with government and military officials and with other economic actors, such as drivers and porters."																															484	No	"Other aspects of market leadership are subordinated to negotiations and dispute settlement. Skills and values important in negotiation were listed by traders as primary criteria in selecting new leaders, and the need for negotiation had often sparked the formalization of the commodity group. A candidate's wealth, for example, which enhances ceremonial display, takes second place to personal qualities required for dispute settlement, which inhibit accumulation. Group members did highly value leaders' ceremonial functions, however, in attending funerals and community celebrations. This public visibility cements group loyalty and also maintains the leaders' prestige and connections, which were drawn upon during crises. Market leaders gain legitimacy and enhance group discipline by adapting titles, ceremonial and court procedures from both traditional and modern models."																															485	No	"The institution of eldership (in Asante, mpanyinfuo) is flexible enough to cover a wide variety of commercial situations and organizational needs. Market ahemma or male chiefs usually have supporting elders that represent small geographical or network sections of their commodity groups and settle minor disputes within that section. Market elders also provide more informal leadership to traders whose commodity has no queen or chief or who sell in fringe locations among neighbors selling many different commodities. These independent elders settle disputes and lead delegations to funerals, but they have no authority to enforce decisions or contributions. They do not attend marketwide meetings."																															486	No	"A good leader should also act with as much formality and dignity as possible on any public occasion so as to enhance the status of her group. She should dress well and exchange visits and gifts with other ahemma and local leaders. One trader remembered with satisfaction a previous ahemma, her relative, who “always went places, so that everyone was mentioning her name.” These standards are goals, by no means ritual obligations. No one condemns leaders of smaller, poorer commodity groups for having to economize or even carry heavy loads on occasion. On the other hand, the ideal encourages traders to choose leaders with enough wealth that they can afford leisure for ceremonies and visiting and can support dependents to handle their less prestigious tasks."																															487	No	"The appropriate criteria for selecting the best candidate are very widely known. Interviews with leaders and followers, men and women and participants and nonparticipants, elicited very consistent lists. Controversy and competition focuses on which among the elders eligible actually has most of these desirable characteristics and on which criteria are the most essential, since it is likely that no candidate has all of them. Specific criteria were explained and justified with reference to the internal and external duties of market leaders. Traders initially volunteer the character traits and skills they consider essential qualifications for performing internal duties, especially dispute settlement. Qualifications useful for external duties, including influential connections and wealth, emerged from discussions of specific past candidates. Traders sometimes condemned or minimized the importance of external criteria, but acknowledged their influence on specific past elections. Those who justified considering these criteria cited the advantages they brought a leader in external negotiations.Traders emphasize impartiality, patience, and honesty as the personal qualities of a good market leader. Electors judge these qualities [Page 275] from a candidate's previous behavior in disputes. A trader who rarely starts disputes, refrains from exaggerated statements, shows little anger, and seeks no revenge shows the correct personality. Experienced traders demonstrate their character and skill by settling small disputes informally among their neighbors and associates. They should listen carefully to all parties, refrain from taking sides, and propose compromises which satisfy both parties. Quick and permanent dispute settlement requires a reputation for fairness as well as the mental ability to find a fair solution. Traders also mention speaking ability as an advantage in a leader. Effective speakers more easily convince disputants of their own interest in abiding by a decision. In negotiations, polished and articulate speeches raise the prestige of traders and gain concessions for them. Finally, graceful language embellishes the many occasions which call for short addresses, including libations, funeral contributions, social visits, and reports of journeys."																															488	No	"Examination of the concrete relations between leaders and followers in Kumasi Central Market commodity groups confirms the central role of dispute settlement in the continuation of the groups. The way age, experience, and wealth appear as threshold rather than absolute ranking criteria for candidates for leadership is directly linked to the norms and tasks involved in dispute settlement. The dominant Asante style of dispute settlement demanded ahemma who were not among the oldest, wealthiest, or most aggressive traders. Ceremonial considerations favor the selection of wealthy traders as leaders, but elders considered this criteria illegitimate and detrimental to group unity. In fact, very wealthy traders tended not to seek group leadership for economic reasons. Drawn from traders of middling status, ahemma do not acquire a distinctive economic position as queens, based on regulatory advantage, fees, or even court fines. Dispute settlement gives ahemma a reactive role in commercial regulation, conservative but not passive in the face of crisis."																															489	No	"If leaders and their groups have shown considerable creativity in combining and transforming varied cultural models of leadership to suit their changing economic and political environment, they still face very real constraints. Factors affecting the character and potency of external [Page 282] negotiations have been especially influential on the strength of market groups. When they formally emerged during the turbulent pre-independence period, they were allowed or even compelled to join in contestations over Africans' and traders' roles in the new national power structure and in competition between political parties. As political parties were repressed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, government hostility intensified against traders and their leaders in particular. They seemed the chosen symbol for frustratingly incomplete government control of economic and organizational life. A later chapter shows that formal market leaders provided easy targets for physical and ideological attack."																															490	No	"Asante women make relatively little use of their own mothers for childcare, still less for other domestic help. Older women have relatively high prestige here, and physical childcare holds rather little. Elderly women are still capable of coming to market daily and taking leadership in lineage and community affairs at quite advanced ages, though they may have curtailed their traveling. Young women cannot depend on the availability of their own mothers during the specific years when they need help most desperately. The short period of years when the mother is still strong enough to look after children but too feeble to go to market is unlikely to match the crisis period of more than one of her daughters. Grandmothers are much more likely to foster grandchildren in order to receive domestic help than to give it."																															491	No	"To answer the first question demands some consideration as to what is considered offence by our code of morals. A Chief cannot simply be destooled because he is in the habit of getting drunk, but a Chief may be destooled if, when drunk or sober, he insults his Elders, and is in the habit of referring contemptuously to the genealogy or pedigree of his subjects and Elders, some of whom might have arisen from a low degree.A Chief absenting himself continuously from his public duties and utilizing the time for his own private purposes, is liable to be called to question. Unwarranted disposal of stool property, including land, is another great cause for deposition. A Chief who is in the habit of depriving his subjects of their wives and sweethearts, courts the ire of his subjects and does so at his own risk. A Chief making use of [Page 116] his subjects with a view to his personal aggrandisement in a way inconsistent with his position, is liable to be called upon for explanation, or otherwise to be given a formal advice to depart from his evil ways."																															492	No	"Personal infirmities which are considered “unholy”, such as leprosy, is a cause for destoolment. In cases like this, the Chief may be asked to resign. Such unusual diseases are thought to be inflicted by the gods and departed ancestors as punishment for a private sin the Chief may have committed. If physical infirmities render a Chief incapable of performing his ordinary labours, he would be asked to make way for a stronger person. An old Chief, infirm with blindness and old age, in one of the Jase towns, in Akim Abuakwa, was formally made to resign, the reason being that as a result of his physical infirmities, his administrative capacities had been greatly impaired."																															493	No	"Lastly, a Chief who repeatedly ignores the advice and counsels of his people, especially of his Elders and Councillors, is liable to destoolment, notably when it appears that his disrespect for his people's advice brings nothing but injurious results on the townspeople."																															494	No	"In ancient times it is said that if a Chief could not, owing to cowardice, lead his army to war, he was liable to be deposed."																															495	No	"A Chief may be destooled if in the absence of definite offences, his general policy brings discontent, unrest, and general unhappiness on his people. That is to say, if he is disliked in his general management of affairs by his people. Such cases usually happen when, for instance, a Chief makes it a habit of engaging in expensive litigations resulting in the taxation of his people."																															496	No	"And it follows that if a Chief embarks upon a novel business or political transaction without the consent of his people, he has only himself to blame for the fatal consequences."																															497	No	"In the past, old women beyond child bearing age often had honoured social positions—as senior wives of a compound, female elders, recognized mediums (akomfo), priests, even female chiefs. Nowadays however, this has somewhat changed owing to the unequal spreading of education."																															498	No	"In the past, persons thus found guilty of “murder” were either killed, or sold into slavery.

The relatives, however, could ask the chief for forgiveness and were given part of the goods of the executed [Page 104] person."																															499	No	"In the nineteen-thirties chiefs' courts were accustomed to deal with a great variety of disputes and offences. Fines paid into court were a source of revenue. When people formed the habit of settling their inter-personal disputes out of court, at shrines, the chiefs conceived a bitter resentment against the shrines and often made gross misrepresentations [Page 91] against them to the government and the police in an effort to get them suppressed.At the present day in Ashanti, most paramount chiefs have agreements with all shrines whereby the latter are permitted to practise only on the condition that they pay one-third of their profits to the chief. Some shrines employ a whole-time secretary to keep their accounts. Other shrines pay no fixed sum, but it is understood that they will assist their chiefs generously in time of need."																															500	No	"To put it generally, the Chief is the right-hand man of the King. By the oath of allegiance which he swears to the King upon his enstoolment he undertakes to be always loyal to the King, to attend to the latter's summons by night or by day, ana fo-o, awia-o, as the native expression runs; and, supported by a religious sanction, it is remarkable how faithful he is to the King, and how harmoniously the Native State System works together in its different parts."																															501	No	"The Headman is par excellence the judge of his family or ward. Not only is he called upon to settle domestic squabbles, but frequently he sits as judge over more serious matters arising between one member of the ward and another; and where he is a man of ability and influence, men from other wards bring him their disputes to settle. When he so settles disputes, he is entitled to a hearing fee, which, however, is not so much as would be payable in the regular Court of the King or the Chief."																															502	No	"The richness and wit of Asante speech and poetry cannot be over-emphasised. Proverbs and aphorisms ( mm[unknown]bus[unknown]m) were a crucial element in everyday life and were continually being invented or modified. Several thousand have been recorded over the last hundred years or so. 3 Knowledge of such sayings was essential for a person to advance in Asante society. They were thought to represent traditional wisdom and served to sway debates and clinch arguments. Senior men and women, and especially chiefs and officials, were expected to know dozens, even hundreds, of these sayings, and in the old days friendly competitions were held to see who knew the most, each person trying to cap the saying offered by the preceding person. With the Asante delight in such sayings went an associated reluctance or unwillingness to refer directly to important matters. Many elegant phrases existed to refer to embarrassing or important matters and were often used to avoid punishment or, at best, ostracism. If a king died, for example, the matter would never be mentioned except through such phrases as ‘the great tree has fallen’, or ‘the King has gone to his village’, or ‘he has gone behind his kra’. Similarly, a girl's first menstruation was indicated by phrases like ‘she's done something’ or ‘she's shot an elephant’. Knowledge of proverbs and aphorisms allowed, even encouraged, an indirect, subtle and allusive form of discussion for, by speaking in proverbs, even the most serious matters could be referred to and explored without having to be mentioned by name."																															503	No	"The entire group, then, takes an interest in the relations of its members. Besides, it is well known that if one leaves the problem of reconciliation to the two quarreling parties there is a good chance that they will only harden in their attitudes, either from pride or from stubbornness. The intervention of the mediator, usually an older man whose word carries some weight (family chief, wise elder, blacksmith, or “joking relative”), causes the two parties to think about what is happening, to empty their hearts of bitterness and bad feelings, and [Page 315] to think about the social consequences. 67"																															504	No	"When a man has succeeded in his “quest” and [Page 383] brings home a new wife, he faces another set of troubles, for he must ensure her good relations with the wife who is already there.

He is always consulted in serious cases, and is the first to be advised of every major occurrence within the group of which he is chief. Everyone addresses him with the greatest respect. His various functions and the continuous contact he maintains with the supernatural powers and ancestral souls, of which he is the guardian, oblige him to observe rigorously a certain number of interdicts, primarily:he does not eat fonio, a grass, which normally is not allowed in the ginna;he neither eats nor drinks with the innepuru, cobblers, smiths and griots;he does not eat animals that are sacrificed at funerals."																															507	No	"	‘The drum with the copper winding is easier for the Nummo to hear.

They settle quarrels occurring between women in the village and assess fines; but in general, the population center is placed under the authority of another chief."																															509	No	"Thus the Hogon by his clothing represents the world; by his movements about his home he participates in the universal rhythm of things, and in addition he controls the calendar through his links with the motion of the stars, and particularly the moon. 11Each Hogon, in the territories within his jurisdiction, and with due regard to arrangements in neighbouring areas, fixes the dates of the various rites and ceremonies. So great is his authority in this sphere that he can omit an important feast without anyone daring to remind him of it. Some chiefs often do so intentionally to display their power. Thus the procession of leaf masks in Sanga was not held at all in 1949 and took place very late in 1950.On the other hand, he is set at the midpoint of time, between two theoretically equal series of predecessors and successors, symbolized by the steps placed before his doorway and his judgment seat."																															510	No	"“The Arou tribe, representing the lineage of Lébé Sérou, appoints one Hogon, priest of Lébé who represents this mythical ancestor. He holds his seat in the village of Arou-near-Ibi, and his authority is felt in particular by all the members of that tribe, no matter what their place of residence. This dignitary is generally considered the political and religious leader of all the Dogon."																															511	No	"By law, the office of family head comes to the one of the descendants from the common ancestor who is the oldest of the survivors of the oldest generation. It always happens that the old men agree to set aside an 88 heir presumptive who would be weak in mind or afflicted with an infirmity rendering him unfit to command, or even when his prodigal temperament would cause [Page 88] 88 cont. fear that he would dissipate the family fortune for his profit. All the authority that the chief possesses comes to him from his advanced age and the experience that one assumes he has. The power that he exercises is delegated to him by the community of which he is only the first among the living; in any case the head would not know how to impose his own will. His position in the group is therefore not that of an autocrat, as one might believe at first sight. It seems scarcely comparable to that of master of the community chosen for this office by his copartners and giving orders to all the others. The Dogon patriarch accommodates himself in large measure to the wishes expressed more or less openly by the members of the group, at the proper time he takes the necessary initiative and announces the decisions, which the others hear, comment upon, approve or censure."																															512	No	"If a quarrel, often for a trifling reason, broke out between two men belonging to different communities, each group immediately sided with its champion, and an expedition was organized under the leadership of a head, anaka[unavailable]e kine, literally, the courageous man chosen by public opinion for his bravery. The importance that the Dogon attach to military prestige even made the pursuit of this honor a source of always latent conflicts. In a similar case, the entire region of Sanga-du-bas (villages of Dyamini na, Dyamini Kouradondo, Bongo, Gogoli) set out under the command of two men of Bongo, while in the region of Sanga-du-haut a single leader grouped under his command the warriors of the villages of Ennguel, Dini, and Sangui, more or less distant kinsmen. The two villages of the Ogols, always interdependent, set out together under the leadership of a single chief."																															513	No	"In the last century, as today, the main function of the chief was the collection and remission of the authorized tax to his superior, who in turn passed it on to the ruler of the state. Salaries were formerly unknown, but officials retained prescribed portions of the tax they had collected, as remuneration, and owing to lack of supervision, were free to over-collect and retain the surplus. The ward-heads were responsible for collecting the tax from their wards, and for the maintenance of good order and discipline in those units. The chiefs, traditionally, had limited judicial powers in civil cases such as marriage, divorce, debt, etc., which did not involve punishment by imprisonment, mutilation and so forth. They were also responsible for the repair of the town wall and defences, the mosque, and the markets and paths throughout their areas. In the nineteenth century the great majority of local communities had settled Fulani as their chiefs, consequent on the Fulani conquest of the Habe states in the jihad of 1804-10."																															514	No	"The term ‘clientage’ has been used frequently above: it designates a variety of relationships, which all have inequality of status of the associated persons as a common characteristic. Only the main types of clientage will be distinguished here. In the political field, clientage as a permanent association between individuals and the titles as corporations has been instanced. Title-holders are themselves clients of their superior, and have subordinate community chiefs as their clients; thus chieftainship is itself a type of clientage, with limitation of the field of eligibility as a characteristic of hereditary chieftainship at any level.

While some mediums live with their spouses and children in neolocal units thus conforming to a common urban Hausa pattern, the majority of the cult-adepts studied were unmarried and lived in rented rooms. Male mediums are more likely to live with wives than female mediums with husbands, but all compounds are organized under the leadership of a senior person, male or female, who may also be a cult-adept. Commonly, residences headed by women are also gidan karuwai (brothels). The female head is expected to have cult status and operates her compound from commissions received from the prostitutes who live there. Residences headed by men vary in their structure, depending on the cult status of the compound leader. ¸"																															517	No	"Their attendants usually try to prevent these exchanges, because all items must be bought back by the spirits’ ‘followers’ immediately after the ceremony. The majority of the gifts given at women’s possession-trance performances are considered by the participants to mark social inequality, and no attempt is made to reciprocate. For example, wealthy patrons are expected to make gifts to the senior cult member in attendance, to the leader of the musician’s group playing for the performance, and to the host at whose invitation the ceremony was called. Guests and observers are expected to give to mediums in possession-trance (actually, as we have noted, to the spirits riding them), particularly those being ridden by ‘their’ spirits, and to musicians and praise-singers. A significant aspect of this kind of gift-giving is that a clear distinction is made between givers and receivers. Whereas musicians never seem to act as gift-givers, cult-adepts may be givers when not involved in possession-trance and receivers when they are. As far as devotees are concerned, anyone may receive gifts; the mark of high cult status is demonstrated by a devotee’s ability or obligation to give gifts. Thus, the gifts given by a medium with an important cult status validate his position vis-à-vis other members of the cult. When the obligation is ignored or the effort judged weak the giver’s status is eroded."																															518	No	" . 9The appointment of the kotso (single-membrane, hand-struck hourglass drum) players in Kano is a case in point. Earlier in this century an Emir of Kano turbanned his own choice as Sarkin Kidan Kotso (Chief of the Drummers of the Kotso) despite musicians’ recommendations to the contrary (Besmer 1972: 42-3).Go to end note pageThe differences in the way leadership is selected in these two types of musicians’ groups seems to emphasize the different criteria for status placement in the social sub-systems in which musicians participate. Achievement plays a minor role as a factor in the assignment of traditional court titles. The candidate’s ascribed status, primarily his genealogical position takes precedence over his deeds. Court musicians, like their patrons, are chosen on the basis of the positions of their relatives and not on their ability as performers. Within the limits of the bori cult, however, achievement is a major factor in the attainment of leadership. Bori musicians must demonstrate their skill as performers before their peers (musicians and cult-adepts) will consider them qualified for nomination."																															519	No	"It is the leader’s responsibility to ensure that a complete ensemble is engaged for any performance, and the host for the event deals only with him. In places where the principal non-musician leadership position in the cult is weak or absent the lute player may also be responsible for inviting the right kinds and number of trancers for the event. This is particularly important for periodic performances which are not tied to special cult rituals the most common of which are weddings and namings."																															520	No	"Customarily, the leader pays them with equal amounts, tending to overpay those who are his direct descendants. The equal shares described by the disgruntled gourd player above in which the leader failed to make the proper distinction between the principal assistant and an ordinary full member of the chorus were due to the fact that the lower-ranked buta player is the leader’s youngest son. This practice is understandable under the general requirement in Hausa society to assist one’s relatives in any way possible, but bori musicians consider it out of place in the pseudo-meritocracy of their performing groups."																															521	No	"The weakening position of the traditional chiefs of the city under the Olubadan began to undermine the effectiveness and legitimacy of the authority of Sabo’s chief, which in the past had been derived from the formal support of the Olubadan and, indirectly, of the District Officer. The ability of the Hausa chief to serve as mediator between his people and the city’s authorities dwindled, as a great deal of that function was passed on to the secretaries of the Sabo branches of the three major political parties. The records of the period are full of petitions presented by these secretaries to the authorities, in protest against all sorts of alleged injustices and acts of discrimination, including the alleged oppression by the police of the Quarter’s 250 prostitutes."																															522	No	"A settled man identifies himself with the Quarter politically and pays allegiance to its Chief. When he marries, the Chief witnesses, validates, and records the marriage, and when his children are born he goes through the naming ceremony at the Chief’s office. When he becomes involved in a dispute in business or in matters of inheritance he asks the Chief to arbitrate. He gives the Chief specified fees as well as presents for all these services. When he passes by the Chief’s office he kneels down as a greeting and token of respect. When the Chief requires him to act in a certain way which is deemed necessary for the general interest of the Quarter he will obey unquestionably.The Chief is an indispensable reference for the honesty and the creditworthiness of a man in Sabo. Strangers coming for the first time from the North to do business with the help of men in the Quarter, nearly always seek the advice of the Chief. The right testimony given by the Chief is sufficient for the strangers to entrust a man with their business. In many contexts the Chief’s help and testimony, in dealings with the local authorities, are of great importance. Similarly, the Chief will mediate on the man’s behalf with chiefs in other Hausa [Page 38] communities in the North or in the South, and in marital and inheritance problems."																															523	No	"When a man in Sabo becomes disabled or old, he usually goes to the Chief of the Quarter and asks his help. The Chief of the Quarter then recommends him to the chief of that category of beggars into which he fits best. The beggars’ chief will then enrol the new member and discuss rules and areas for begging with him. During my period of field work, a commission agent in the cattle market became blind and was unable to continue in his job. The Chief of the Quarter suggested that the man should become a beggar and should enrol with the Chief of the Blind. The man agreed and the Chief of the Quarter duly talked to the Chief of the Blind. The man was admitted into the organization. He was provided with a guide and assigned places for begging. He continued to be accommodated in the house given to him by his former business landlord."																															524	No	"In Sabo, however, a woman can either ask her husband to divorce her by pronouncing the divorce formula and signing a letter for her confirming it, or, if he refuses, she can ask people to put pressure on him to do so. If she fails in such efforts, she can go to the Chief of the Quarter and put a case before him and his counsellors. Judging from the cases which I recorded, the Chief will nearly always grant a wife a divorce and his judgement is only important in determining whether the wife is obliged to return the marriage payment or not. If the worst comes to the worst, the wife can, as a last resort, just run away from her husband and pose as a prostitute. The Chief justifies the ease with which he grants divorce to wives, on the ground that if he did not, the wives would become prostitutes somewhere else. A wife whose marriage is annulled by the Chief, gets from him a written document to that effect so that when she wants to remarry in another place she will produce it in evidence."																															525	No	"The Chief of the Quarter has often had trouble with the local Yoruba authorities over the prostitutes and it seems to me that, in order to avoid such trouble, the prostitutes have been accommodated in houses which have been sold to Yoruba men living in the town, who come to the Quarter only once a month to [Page 64] collect rent. In this way Hausa landlords and the Hausa Chief can avoid direct responsibility for harbouring the prostitutes."																															526	No	"No house or right in housing can be sold in Sabo without the knowledge, mediation, and hence approval of the Chief of the Quarter. The Chief acts as arbitrator in cases of disputes over business matters and he can force a business man to sell more, or in some cases all, of his housing rights in order to settle his debts. This means that no man can pull out of the Quarter easily in order to escape from his financial obligations. To a very large extent, his housing rights are a pledge in the hands of the community, as represented by the Chief. As a man sells some or all of his rights in housing, he proportionally loses part or all of his creditworthiness. As there is little conspicuous consumption in the Quarter and as men are not used to entrusting their money to banks, housing has also become the most important form of saving."																															527	No	"Within the cattle trade, one source of tension and sometimes of quarrels between a landlord and the Chief of the Quarter has been over this issue. Often, when a new cattle dealer comes for the first time to the Quarter and goes to the Chief for accommodation and advice, the Chief will persuade the man to entrust the sale of his cattle to the Chief’s own business house. The Chief is thus frequently accused by his colleagues in the cattle trade of exploiting his public office to advance his own private business interests."																															528	No	"It was no closely guarded secret in the Quarter that the gamblers and the thieves had their own unturbanned chief, to whom I shall refer as Yaro. Yaro was a very forceful person and had a strange network of unorthodox connections with many people within and outside the Quarter. His role among the thieves was that of a protector and blackmailer at one and the same time. He exacted protection money from the three gambling houses, at the fixed fee of 5/- a week for each circle. He was an old settler and his name recurs in the records from the late 1940’s. People in the Quarter said that he had connections with men of power and influence outside the Quarter to whom he regularly paid part of the ‘fees’ he obtained. He serves as what may be called ‘Black Market Fixer’. A man who had problems within the City outside the Quarter, would first go to the Chief of the Quarter for help. But if the Chief failed in his efforts, or refused, the man would secretly contact Yaro, ‘The Chief of the Thieves’, as informants called him. While the Chief of the Quarter specialized in contacts with men from the traditional elite, Yaro specialized in contacts with other types of men of influence."																															529	No	"Thus by that time Umaru emerges in the records, as well as in the accounts of informants, as the most powerful man in Sabo. He had succeeded in acquiring a large number of houses, and with his money he had started many of his clients off as traders or as agents working for him. The number of men living in his houses, and therefore paying unquestionable political allegiance to him, increased tremendously. His praise singers were loudly active on every occasion and he had gathered around him a number of influential men to act as his advisors and retainers. He had official messengers through whom he communicated with the Olubadan and with other officials in the city. His sources of income included not only his trade and activities as business landlord but also his role as arbitrator in cases of financial disputes, when he exacted 10% of the amounts involved in the disputes. He also collected fees for his service in solemnizing marriages and the naming of newly born babies and also for witnessing divorces. But he also spent lavishly by making regular payments to his advisors and other supporters. He gave money also to malams and to the needy. He maintained houses for Hausa strangers and also paid the expenses of the funeral and burial of every Hausa stranger who died in the province. His people feared him but they also respected him: they saw in him a shrewd leader who was capable of manipulating both the colonial administrators and the Yoruba chiefs to guard the interests of the Quarter’s business."																															530	No	"During the period of Indirect Rule, the Chief of the Quarter enjoyed a great deal of coercive power, indeed well beyond the formal limits of his authority. He could easily frame people, arrest them and hand them over to the police, by denouncing them as thieves or ‘undesirables’. In some cases he even ordered his messengers to manhandle or assault people whom he regarded as deviants. Potentially, he could also mobilize other members of the community to stage physical assaults on individuals or groups. As he was the only formal link between the [Page 172] community and the authorities, he could withhold, or threaten to withhold, his support of individuals who were not loyal to him. However, with the coming of party politics he lost much, if not all, of this use, or threat of the use, of coercion. Today he can still blackmail people by treatening to denounce them to the authorities or to withhold his goodwill and support, but to a much lesser extent than before."																															531	No	"These primary groups are interlinked in a variety of ways which have truly made the order into a [Page 173] ‘brotherhood’. A man will run the risk of losing membership of these groups if he acts against the political interests of the Quarter. Disobedience to the Chief reverberates immediately and becomes an infringement of the norms and values of the small groups. A man’s friends are also his ritual ‘brothers’, with whom he may also have direct or indirect economic relations. They are his comrades in political confrontations with the Yoruba."																															532	No	"One of the most severe sanctions in the hands of the Chief of the Quarter is that of ‘public scandalizing’. This is a sanction, or threat of a sanction, which he uses only in serious cases of dispute and only as an ultimate measure against an important man whom he cannot threaten or punish effectively in other ways. I did not myself have the opportunity of witnessing this sanction being actually used against anyone, but I recorded from accounts by informers a number of cases, one of which had occurred only a few months before I began my study in the Quarter."																															533	No	"In the analysis of Kàaka’s support in Tudù (Chapter 8), it appears that Kàaka’s support base of legitimacy gives him the power to generate more personal support and even greater power. In fact, it seems that the more a leader uses his power to develop personal support, the more likely it is that his legitimacy will erode, since his pursuit of personal goal will inevitably contravene social values. On the basis of the analysis in Chapter 8, I would also add that a leader may be restrained from using his consensual power for personal goals by the presence of countervailing factors. For example, a person might hesitate to bannish an opponent if he believes that such autocracy will undermine his legitimacy to such an extent that another rival could rally enough opposition to his act to depose him.A further conceptual scheme should also be included, one which amounts to a paraphrase of Lord Acton’s dictum that “power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.” As a leader obtains consensual support, he secures with it the power to command compliance to his personal goals. As his legitimacy grows, he is increasingly inclined to use this power, which use erodes his legitimacy and tempts the leader to resort to more expedient and efficient means to gain compliance -- i.e. coeroion -- which may undercut or replace his legitimacy as a support form."																															534	No	"While its role as the possessor of the village chiefship sharply distinguishes the Ma’kìiri clan from the other village clans in terms of function, the competitions for control of the chiefship point up their differences in structure. Within the village, the only hard and fast rule for succession eligibility to the chiefship has been membership in [Page 129]Notes: a. Capital letters denote the names of the clan segments existing presently. b. The numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of households affiliated to the segment. c. The underlined numbers refer to the clan segment’s population. Figure 5 Clan Segments of the Ma’kìiri Clan[Page 130] the Ma’kìiri clan. Many informants stated that a preference exists for an incumbent’s eldest lineal son, while others said the younger brother of the incumbent would be the more likely candidate for the chiefship. The actual history of succession to the chiefship displays no clear rule of agnatic succession; in fact, the French intervened in 1926 to install a chief of their own choice. Yet this appointee (Kàaka) has been able to maintain his control of the chiefship only by competing effectively for support within the village."																															535	No	"There are four principal roles which the villagers expect Kàaka to perform as village chief: adjudicate disputes, collect taxes, be hospitable to strangers, and sponsor bòorii and mùushee dances during the two annual festivals or when drought threatens to result in famine."																															536	No	"The community further expects that their chief will sponsor a bòorii or mùushee dance when a lack of rain threatens crops. In mid-July 1968 after several weeks of little or no rain, Kàaka gave 3000CFA to Abdù as head of the ‘yam mùushee to put on a dance in Kàaka’s gida . The dance, attended by nearly all the villagers, lasted all one afternoon, and according to Abdù, had the goal of beseeching the mùushee to drive away the wayward bòorii who had prevented the storms from passing over the area. By sponsoring this dance, Kàaka reinforced his support by the villagers by meeting their expectations of him."																															537	No	"Having described the values which orient behavior in the village and Kàaka’s qualifications and performance in office, I turn now to describing actual events where rivals competed for support to control the chiefship. The competitions are based on the contestants’ belief that the office and chiefly roles have considerable worth. The dominant benefit of becoming chief is the power that the chief wields; this is discussed extensively in 8.6.2. Kàaka has used this power, based to be sure on the consent of the majority of villagers, to undercut his rivals’ support. The office also grants its holder the right to exempt his own GIDA from the corvèe labor occasionally requisitioned by the sarkii and the sous-préfet . Further, the chief ćan use the money he collects in taxes to make short-term, high-yield investments before he relinquishes the capital as tax monies to the sous-préfecture . 30. I have followed the custom in Tudù of labeling as Muslim those people who pray the required five times daily and who maintain the Ramadan fast. Those who neither do the prayers nor keep the fast are called non-Muslim or A’rna. In terms of belief, there is little that differentiates the Muslim from the A’rna. These differences, however, are elaborated in Chapter 5.Go to end note pageThe village chief has the right to keep all fines that he collects for himself. Kàaka, since he presides over an effective hence popular moot, has found this to be a substantial income averaging about 3,500CFA per month. A final value of the chiefship is the elusive quality of prestige. The office holder finds that he becomes widely [Page 187] known and that he is deferred to by villagers in his own and in other communities."																															538	No	"With Kàaka’s influence as chief, his personal legitimacy, and his wealth, he has been able to arrange marriages of both lineal and collateral sons and daughters (used in a classificatory sense) to ally his GIDA with other clans. The effect has been to oblige an increasing number of people to support him personally on the basis of kinship solidarity. Likewise, with these same techniques Kàaka has marshalled the support of his clients and their households on the basis of the clients’ obligation to be loyal to their master."																															539	No	"n Chapter 1, I ended by suggesting that political leaders whose support is primarily based on legitimacy have the flexibility of action to command compliance to personal as well as to public goals. The more a leader uses his power to develop personal support, the more likely it is that his legitimacy will erode, since his pursuing purely personal ends will inexorably lead to his contravention of social values. Leaders are often restrained from such pursuit of personal goals by an awareness of the potential loss of legitimacy support which might ensue, although it seems the more personal power a leader possesses, the more unlikely it is that he will recognize this loss and will rely on more intrinsically effective means of securing compliance (i.e. coercion)."																															540	No	"Because of a complex set of political forces, there is much mobility of political leaders from one post to another throughout the emirate (Cohen 1964). This sometimes means that client-followers of a political leader, especially those given local political offices such as village area head, may maintain affiliations to political leaders who are not part of the present political hierarchy in their area."																															541	No	"One of the most interesting features of such raids occurred when the Bornu troops would rush upon a group of fleeing pagans and then suddenly an order would be given to stop the raid. Kanuri leaders would shout “Amana, Amana!” and their followers would know immediately that this particular group had to be let alone. (Barth, Vol. II: 400-401) The word amana means “trust” or “in the trust of,” and refers to two extremely important Kanuri institutions. The word can be used to describe the content of working superior-subordinate relations which involve disciplined respect. (Cohen 1965; 1967) To the Kanuri aman or amana is what makes such relationships work for the benefit of all concerned. Thus, ego can give respect to his social superiors by visiting them in their homes. This is called “giving respect” or nona . "																															542	No	"Contenders for the throne each have their own following among the nobles and among those of their followers who hope one day to achieve noble titles and the prerogatives that go with them. Generally, the leading faction is that of the reigning monarch, since he can control appointments to titled offices as well as distribute, or redistribute, fief-holdings traditionally; thus he rewards followers more thoroughly than his competitors. However, at times of interregnum, or of revolution, or when a ruling monarch is extremely old, such factionalism becomes important, since the royal office is the goal of competition at that point and the winning faction stands to gain control of the most effective authority position in the state."																															543	No	"Men look forward to the rising status that comes with advanced years and feel that the age period of 35-40 is a turning point of life. Frivolity is excusable before this age, but beyond it they consider themselves senior people. This means they should divorce less often, appear less in public, and take on leadership responsibilities in their households and local communities. "																															544	No	"The attributes of a political title and the history of success of the titleholder and the previous titleholders also provided gross measures of status, since the titles were divided up into categories—one for royalty, one for officials of the royal court, titles for free nobles of the court, titles for slaves of the court, several of which were reserved for eunuchs, and titles for religious functionaries of the court, and heads of occupations in the capital. There were also titles for rural chieftaincies and titles for followers of powerful men. As we shall see in the discussion on mobility, more exact measures of status distinctions were, however, made on the basis of a man’s achieved prerogatives in the political systems, so that holders of particular titles varied greatly through time as to the status position they were accorded in the overall society."																															545	No	"Great and powerful men always go to very many, and/or send gifts to friends and relatives who are giving ceremonies. A spendthrift, then, is a man who goes not only to those ceremonies he is obliged to go to, but to many others as well. Besides this he gives more than he receives to those with whom he does have reciprocal obligations. This means that his giftgiving relations to others for ceremonial purposes tend to become redistributive, like the men in positions of political leadership, rather than reciprocal as it is with most people. 22. See Cohen, R., 1965.If a man has adequate means to give larger and more gifts than others, he can be spoken of as being socially mobile; if not, then he is considered foolish, imprudent, and unable to withstand the temptation to be thought of as better off than he really deserves."																															546	No	All residents of this new settlement look upon its founder as their local leader. Disputes between members are always taken to Aji before going to any higher authorities while disputes with outsiders follow the general Bornu rule of going first to a political leader superior in rank to both participants.																															547	No	"At first glance these followers are indistinguishable from ordinary peasants except for the fact that some of them have expensive looking horses given to them by the district head. They help collect nomad cattle taxes, run messages for the district head, and never fail to ride in honor of their leader on special ceremonial occasions or when an important visitor has come to town. Most important they must be willing to leave town or move to another place whenever their superior is stationed elsewhere, while peasants are most often linked by social relations with a particular spot. These men have only one allegiance—that of subordination, discipline and respect to their superior, the district head. Thus they are never fully trusted by the more permanent local residents. Indeed younger members of the district head’s following are often feared as well as mistrusted. They have no farms, no wives, and no households of their own. They talk, play cards, drink, look for amorous experiences in the local area, and are felt to be spies for the district head. When such men approach a group of peasant menfolk, the conversation suddenly stops, then slowly begins again on a note of pleasant but iridescent chit-chat in which nothing really serious or informative about local affairs is ever mentioned. Although the hierarchy of lawan and bullama under a district head is his official administrative organization in the district, his followers form an unofficial organization to execute his policies. Unlike the lawan and bullama they are totally dependent upon him for support and status in the society. In return they give him the prestige that comes from having a large retinue of followers. They also organize his tax collections, act as messengers, and sometimes they are even used to discipline lawans who are not complying with administration demands. Thus one lawan complained to a district head that he could not raise the tax assessment for his village [Page 101] area. The district head sent out his followers who gathered about fifty percent more than the original assessment and the lawan was then chastised and sent back with the warning that he must comply in the future with directives from the district head."																															548	No	"As suggested above there is sometimes a strain in the relations between a district head and the various lawans who head up the village areas within the district. Formally he relays directives from the capital to them in their village areas and they are supposed to carry out these policies. However, the district head needs cooperation, often for necessary but somewhat semi-illicit activities and thus needs people he can trust in leadership positions within the district. On his side the lawan is semi-independent because he is a salaried official. District heads are constantly trying to win the affection and loyalty of their lawans, or if necessary to get them expelled, or wait until they retire and then have the office filled by one of their own loyal followers. Because district heads are constantly being retired, dismissed, or transferred from one district to another, each new district head is confronted with a number of lawans who are the loyal followers of predecessors who were district heads in the area."																															549	No	"In Maiduguri at the eastern end of the royal plaza is the palace of the Shehu, flanked on one side by the mosque and on the other by the official residence of the Waziri or chief minister of the emirate. The Shehu is the formal head of government. All measures, policies, appointments, made within the state are in his name; titles are granted at official investiture ceremonies carried on in the royal palace and he is the formal leader of the religious community of the state. This is embodied [Page 106] in his title, “commander of the faithful,” and is expressed ritually in a number of ways. Thus at the feast celebrating the end of Ramadan (the annual Muslim fast), a special ram of the Shehu is killed by the chief religious leader of the state. No one considering himself a citizen of the emirate and a subject of the Shehu is supposed to kill his own ram for the feast day until the royal ceremony is completed."																															550	No	"Finally we should ask one more question. How much power does the royal office still hold? A precise answer is extermely difficult. The Shehu obtains approximately $30,000 annually as a basic salary. He receives many gifts and tributes from the people, the district heads, and many lesser chiefs. Certainly it is wide-spread knowledge in Bornu that applicants for the job of district head should ply the Shehu with gifts before the decision is made. These sources of income make him very powerful economically. On the other hand, people believe he is actually very poor since he gives so much of his money away to followers and suppliants."																															551	No	It is also interesting to note that at least part of the morale of Shehu Laminu’s army resided in the general belief in his supernatural powers as a military leader. The night before the battle witnessed by Denham it was reported that Laminu had written charms (verses from the Koran) and his enemies’ spears and arrows were blunted and found so in the morning by their owners on the day of battle. 																															552	No	"Although one case was observed, it must be emphasized that such instances are rare in the contemporary society. Only political leaders from the level of town head up, and hereditary nobles were observed to keep concubines. An extremely wealthy trader, who felt very proud of his four wives in seclusion, answered that it would be improper of him to have a concubine because he was only a trader. "																															553	No	"Any man who obtains material surpluses may begin to use his property to obtain discipline-respect ( b[unknown]erzum ) relationships with an expanding group of followers. Contrarily, a man whose material wealth is declining finds his followers less apt to remain within his organization. This is one of the primary elements in the operation of political and economic power."																															554	No	"Finally, growing up for the Kanuri child never has meant invariably assuming the role and status of his parents. Persons of religious or military talent could rise to positions of leadership and, most important, the old client-patron system 8 has always provided openings for the advancement of children from lower socioeconomic groups. Added to these traditional means of mobility have been the limited opportunities made available for almost fifty years through Western education."																															555	No	"t is said that every time a Drum Chief killed a man corresponding to rods (AKO) handed him by the Aku of Wukari, the Drum Chief gave this life to one of his retinue and in return, the latter imparted to him the secrets of his particular branch of the mba tsav, until gradually the Drum Chief was expert in all branches of this knowledge."																															556	No	"This is true of the Tiv area, where there is no heridatary chieftainship but where, as we have seen, the ‘Drum Chiefs’ were those who had reached the highest stage of initiation."																															557	No	"Ed.: “The conception of executive chieftainship is foreign to the Tiv. It is not suited to the tribal temperament or social organization. Yet when the British first took over the control of the tribe, and prepared to divide it up into administrative units each under a district head, according to the policy of that time, they found the idea of chiefs already in existence. This idea was, in point of fact, of recent growth, and was the outcome of contact with other races at a different stage of political development, whom they found living in the plains of the Benue valley when they came out of the hills. It has been suggested that the demand for some sort of political authority was created by the unsettled conditions which followed upon the Chamba invasions. ( 1 ) Attacked on their borders by tribes possessing a more advanced political and military organization than themselves, and harassed by interclan quarrels arising out of disputes over their newly acquired territory and the forcible capture of each other’s women, it would not be surprising if the Tiv felt the need for leaders with wider and more dictatorial powers than the elders of the tiny independent units into which the tribe was divided. One type of chief, the kur , copied from the Donga section of the Chamba people by some of the south-easterly clans, had certainly a semi-military origin and function. But if the germ of a clan consciousness was ever born of the necessity for showing a united front and submitting to the commands of a single military or political leader, it did not survive long after the immediate danger of foreign invasion was removed. Even the name kur is now almost forgotten.”"																															558	No	"Among the Tiv it is the political leader who is credited with the greatest knowledge of genealogical data in all their ramifications. This opinion represents a twofold process. No man who hopes to attain political leadership can afford to be known as a man ‘who doesn’t know things’. The aspirant to such leadership makes a point of acquiring the knowledge cited at moots and handed on privately by the political leaders of that time. Secondly, whatever is cited by a man who has attained great political influence is accepted as valid and true. Where there is such a man—and only one—one finds a fairly standardized genealogy given throughout his sphere of influence, and there is little argument about the genealogy applied on any one occasion. But one will not find him consistent with himself from [Page 308] time to time as we understand consistency. Indeed, to look for such consistency is to misunderstand the basis for variation in Tiv genealogies."																															559	No	"As a result, any account of Tiv leadership must discuss leadership in these two aspects: “against” and “within,” or, if one prefers and will remember that the lineage level concerned is contextual, “foreign” and “domestic” affairs. However, the lineage structure itself, by an association of union with opposition, brings it about that emotively the feeling of “within” and of unity in any given segment is strongest when “foreign” affairs are concerned, and that the emergence of latent cleavages is most prominent and the achievement of unity most difficult in “internal” affairs. That is, a leader wields his greatest influence “within” when he is a leader “against.” This principle needs no modification if one remembers that the lineage span is variable. Only if one attempts to pin leadership to a definite lineage (I), does it break down unless one specifies that within I, X is the leader of A; within A, he is the leader of “ i, ” and so on literally to the point at which he is himself “against” his full brother."																															560	No	"Any position of leadership attained by a Tiv depends ultimately upon his ability and personality. Certainly, whatever his advantages, no man without a strong personality could become a man of any prominence. In Tiv ideal, a leader should act and speak quietly, but with conviction and determination; a hot-tempered on hasty man is deplored. He should be a man of sincerity and integrity. But there are also Tiv who have acquired influence through force of character, intimidation, a talent for intrigue and bribery. Such people are not held up as examples to the young; they are also likely to be referred to as “witch leaders” ( utor mbastav as a sign both of their unscrupulous character and of the fear in which they are heldThere are almost no heritable distinctions or disabilities connected with leadership, though several factors are advantageous to a man seeking leadership. Tiv say [Page 33] that the son of an important man is in a better position than the son of a man of small importance because he was able to witness his father’s activities and thus to gain both knowledge and experience. Again certain akombo are connected with “repairing the tar ” ( s[unknown]ron tar ) and thus eventually with more secular political activities. Some of these akombo could not be held by the sons of non-Tiv women; others could be legitimately held only by the child of a completed exchange marriage (a distinction disappearing since the abolition of exchange marriage in 1927). Finally, some highly important magical properties (particularly swem ), which are closely connected with justice, government, and individual integrity, are held to pass from a man to one of his descendants (or brother’s descendants). For this reason an influential man who does not trace his influence to his father’s (or other close agnate’s) personal and mystical position is often, and especially by his enemies, called a “witch leader” ( tyoor mbatsav ), both because he is held to be in illegitimate possession of certain aspects of magic connected with “repairing the land” ( s[unknown]ron tar ) and because he has succeeded in the face of difficulties."																															561	No	"n a consideration of Tiv leadership one may distinguish roughly between ( a ) elders, ( b ) men of affluence and prestige, and ( c ) men who, generally by a combination of these two roles, became men of wider political influence. Or, to rephrase this distinction in a manner frequently used by the Tiv, there are men who excel in the “way of repairing the tar ” ( gbwenda u s[unknown] tar ) and those who excel in the “way of prestige” ( gbwenda u shagba ) and, rarely, a man both wise in repairing the tar and rich in prestige. By and large, the emphasis of the “way of prestige” is the more secular, that of repairing the tar the more mystical. But nothing could give a falser picture of Tiv leadership than a strict differentiation of governmental activities into civil and religious. References in this section to “secular” and “mystical” should be taken as indications of a greater proportion of the one or the other; the terms are not mutually exclusive among the Tiv."																															562	No	"The rise of a man of affluence to a position of influence is correlated with his acquisition of akombo, drums and titles (Jukun and Utur bought) for which he is believed to sacrifice human beings. This notion has two important implications, both arising from the belief that the sacrificial victims are killed by witchcraft. First, the consent of the elders is necessary, since, as witches ( mbatsav ) themselves, they have the power to prevent or punish by counter-witchcraft, the witchcraft of any one individual. Secondly, although such sacrifice is condoned by public opinion when the object is the welfare of the tar in any of its aspects, its association with an individual’s rise in influence is almost always condemned. Since all the ways of gaining influence on the “way of prestige” ( gbwenda u shagba ) are correlated with the rise of an individual, rather than with the welfare of the tar, the rise of a man of affluence to influence through these means is directly correlated with the dilemma involved in Tiv leadership: he is envied, feared, and hated (for his sacrifice of lives for personal advantage) by the very people who assist his progress in order that they may have protection against others and may share a reflected prestige over and against others."																															563	No	"There was no hierarchy of such leaders. In lineage I (see Fig. 4), A and B might each have a man of influence: which of them would appear as the leader [Page 37] of I when I appeared against lineage II, depended on several factors. First and most important was sheer power of personality. When two such men are closely matched, first one then the other may appear as leader of I; those who know Tiv will remember Kiagba and Adamgbe in Kunav. The second factor concerns the actual and specific possession of certain ritual and magic closely connected with the tar, the most important single item being swem . That the first factor may, however, outweigh the second is seen in the doctrine that even the most legitimately inherited swem may diminish in power if held by a weak or bad man; swem enhances, legitimizes, and to a certain extent ensures the beneficial use of influence, but it cannot by itself produce influence. All things being equal, if there is a swem in A and not in B, the possessor of swem in A will emerge as the leader of I; the association is strong enough to make B want to buy, borrow, steal, or fake a swem ."																															564	No	"Women’s cooperative labour groups are more restricted, because there are not so many different types of ties which they can activate for the purpose. The women of a compound may unite, under the nominal leadership of a senior woman, and weed the farms of all, after which they have a beer drink as guests of the senior woman or of her group of linked wives and daughters-in-law. A woman may brew beer and send out word to the neighbouring compounds for women to help her hoe or weed in return for beer; a woman known to be generous with beer may get some 20 women in this way. It gives a woman great prestige to organize, in return for food and beer, the women of her compound to weed the farms and chop wood for a lineage sister or, especially, for her mother-in-law remarried into another lineage."																															565	No	"Those men who are considered the most influential elders of the community ‘by day’ are said to be the ‘witches’ by night. ‘Witches’ is not a good translation of mbatsav, even in the light only of other African data. Leadership—indeed, all ability—is an attribute, Tiv say, of a substance called tsav which grows on the heart of some men. A man of tsav ( or tsav ) is a man of talent. The talent includes mystical power."																															566	No	Tiv see all leaders in two lights: as their protectors and as their eventual vanquishers.																															567	No	"Tsuwa—one of his best qualifications for leadership is that he can shout over any crowd—affirmed again that it was MbaGôr’s land. 2 Iyorvenda rose and walked away without uttering a word, and was followed silently by all the elders of MbaWandia. "																															568	No	"There seems to be one elder in a kindred who is regarded as the leader or the most important; he often has some special emblem such as the ‘imborivungu’ but apart from this special position they are all equal. This principal elder naturally has more weight in council. In the unit of Niongov I found Akushi, the elder of Ihangev family group the most prominent."																															571	No	"At first, MaBa’s charism succeeded in counteracting tendencies to divide, but after his death family and personal interests were usually stronger than the common interest in the new Muslim society. In Saloum as well as in Gambia, marabouts, their lieutenants, royal princes and bandits fought and robbed each other, whereby coalitions were as easily broken as formed because of traditional rivalries, ethnic differences and personal interests. Hereditary chieftaincy was replaced by office based on success in war."																															572	No	"	The village chief ( ri-jang ) is the principal contact between the villagers and the government. The two village chiefs who have served since the May 1961 coup d’etat have both been army veterans, and the policy of the military government has been to appoint only veterans to this position (Interview 1).	"																															573	No	"The present village chief attended high school in Po-un, but did not graduate. His predecessor was a middle school graduate. The office of village chief has traditionally been regarded as a job for a man in early middle age who serves as the instrument of the village elders, who are the real community leaders, and is their intermediary in dealing with the government ( cf. , Pak and Lee 1963:151-152)."																															574	No	"The village chief fulfills unofficial functions in organizing community-wide activities of a non-governmental character. For example, he supervised the financial arrangements for the sacrifice to the mountain spirit on the first full moon night of the lunar new year, in cooperation with the village elders. A small sum was collected from each house in the ri , and the three households in Talani which had prepared the sacrificial food were reimbursed for their expenses. At a meeting to settle accounts after the sacrifice the village chief proposed that the 195 won ($1.30) left over after expenses had been paid should be used to buy shoes ( ko-mu-shin ) as a gift for the man who had conducted the sacrifice and that whatever remained after that purchase be used to buy a gift for another individual who had been especially involved in the ceremony. The old men at the meeting agreed to this proposal by acclamation. 22"																															575	No	"The village chief is assisted in performing his duties by five pan chiefs ( pan jang ), one for each of the ri ’s five administrative subdivisions ( pan ). The pan chief helps the village chief in collecting data about the households under his supervision. At least one pan chief, the one in Talani, is not a Kyongju Kim. This might indicate some “discrimination,” since the position of pan chief is unpaid and is, in other places at least, widely regarded as an undesirable job (Pak and Lee 1963: 150)."																															576	No	"The village chief, a forty-six year old Kyongju Kim, said that the “richest man in the village” is a Kyongju Kim who owns 7.27 acres 158,900 p’yong .of wet fields and 3.66 acres 164,500 p’yong .of dry fields and is one of the major tobacco growers there. The most remote agricultural land farmed by the villagers is two kilometers away, according to the same informant (Interview 75)."																															577	No	"Other relatively young men (in their late thirties) of some competence and popularity recently have been appointed to such positions as local head of the fisheries cooperative or supervisor of a dike building project. Although they do not possess enough land to be potential village leaders in accordance with the qualifications established above, they are pointed to with pride by their fellow clansmen. Jobs such as these, although temporary, have a bureaucratic aura that carries considerable prestige."																															578	No	"A more intangible quality affecting prestige is the role of individual popularity in interpersonal relations. If an air of quiet dignity and calm measured self-expression is most admired and most influential in formal councils, this is usually not the case in the everyday casual groups where men gather to pass a good deal of their time. Ribald jokes and the noisy vehement expression of ideas are more normal in such gatherings, although there are variations according to neighborhood and situation in the kind of behavior that is considered appropriate. What often happens is that men gravitate to the group they find most congenial. In this sense different kinds of charisma are effective within the village, and influential men draw followers, usually of approximately the same age, from other neighborhoods and other clans."																															579	No	"Within the village a broad distinction can be made between authority based on formal, permanent hierarchical factors and the kind of direction that is usually exerted informally in an egalitarian context. Hierarchical concepts of authority ordinarily are associated with lineage structure--specifically, genealogical rank, age, and reputation. Bureaucratic authority, also hierarchical in nature, is only an occasional phenomenon in village affairs. Ideally it depends on moral superiority attained through education. Outside the context of lineage and formal bureaucracy strong leadership has no legitimation, and in fact villagers are opposed to it, both in theory and in practice.Traditionally, notions of hierarchical leadership are associated with philosophy and ethics rather than with the accomplishment of practical goals. Hierarchy in S[unknown] okp'o is the ranking of persons in terms of moral worth rather than a chain of command for the exercise of authority. In this regard village ideology faithfully mirrors Chinese social ethics. According to the doctrine, social harmony can only be achieved through the establishment of correct human relations, and for this goal relative status must be clearly expressed. Villagers regard highranking [Page 103] persons as responsible for ethical and ceremonial leadership, not the direction of everyday activities, and this is true of the county magistrate as well as of the clan elders."																															580	No	"Of course, men of higher personal reputation or demonstrated skill have more influence in such situations, but everyone has his say and the process of reaching a consensus is often not only noisy but subtle and time consuming as well. An authoritative tone of command concerning work in progress as a rule is just an assertion of personal status. If it is legitimate, the other person will ordinarily defer. If not, it will be countered by an equally positive and usually contradictory statement. In neither case does the barking of orders seem to have much to do with how the job is eventually accomplished. In the absence of clear leadership responsibility, aggressive confident individuals are constantly asserting themselves and just as constantly canceling each other out."																															581	No	"Owners of boats and net crews or landowners who hire agricultural labor sometimes complained that they could never delegate authority. If the owner does not constantly reassert his position and demonstrate that he is actually in charge, some of the men working for him will ignore orders and take things into their own hands. It is significant that when larger work groups are formed to carry out new development projects, the members belong to an approximate peer group that traditionally operates in this loosely structured manner and leadership is often a problem. Although a man will accept the authority of his father, [Page 106] older brother, or uncle without question, he tends to resist efforts by almost anyone else to exercise continuing and consistent control over his activities. Conflicts seem inevitably to arise when villagers participate in joint enterprises such as the operation of large deep-sea vessels or construction of a dike where prolonged responsible leadership is necessary."																															582	No	"On the other hand, when people gather in the village in considerable numbers to work together transplanting rice, putting on a roof, hauling nets, or threshing grain, they all possess the necessary skills and are accustomed to working together. As a result, a great deal of work gets done without strong leadership being necessary. But enthusiasm for sustained hard work is quickly dissipated in an atmosphere of disciplined regulation where the element of traditional egalitarian sociability is missing."																															584	No	"At the center of village politics is the yijang (village head), who is chosen in a formal selection process. The my[unknown]onjang (subcounty chief) recommends a man able to deal with village administration to the kunsu (county chief appointed by the central national government). The kunsu names a person to serve as yijang for a given village. A yijang is thus a representative of a village from the viewpoint of the subcounty and county government. The government pays him a monthly salary of 10,000 w[unknown]on (about $ 20), and his villagers collect rice and barley as yij[unknown]ongse (village administrative tax) for the yijang twice yearly. There is a spring yij[unknown]ongse of barley and a fall yij[unknown]ongse of rice after each harvest. The yijang reports the villagers’ vital statistics and the results of harvesting to the subcounty government, and he provides data on births and deaths for the villagers as well as for the higher governmental administration. He also receives information, for example, on military training that might lead to the unmasking of North Korean spies, on reforestation. He, also, is sent all directives [Page 170] from the subcounty government, the police station, the Agricultural Cooperative Association, the Fishery Cooperative Association, the school board, and other agencies. He is thus a kind of messenger between the village and the various different levels and arms of government. The yijang in the village of Hasami is 44 years old and is relatively rich."																															585	No	"May one say that the chairwoman of the club was merely a figurehead because she, as head of the meeting, did not seem to have any distinctive influence? If one retains the idea of a ‘western political model’ based on a democratic structure, she is a figurehead for the group. To carry the idea through, however, the procedure of discussion and decision-making is not based on an idea of democracy but rather on that of unanimity. In this context, the ‘leader’ does not have to be a person of marked influence in the decision-making process. She is not a figurehead but rather a middleman in the meeting, functioning, in effect, as a go-between for the group. There is no despotic idea in the context of a total consensus in this essentially egalitarian society. The chairwoman stands as a middleman between the government and the village. Although the government may call her a ‘leader’ in the village, she properly does not occupy this role."																															586	No	"The government sent 100 sacks of cement to the village for such projects as the construction of a dike between the village road and the seashore and the paving of the village roads. When there is a need to build and extend the dike in front of the onggumak, the leader asks the villagers to participate in the work and makes a division of three working spaces for the three pan . Most villagers resist being summoned to do the work, which would force them to miss an entire day of labor for their own families. Villagers prefer instead to do their own land and sea work. The yijang scolds some villagers who take cement to repair fireplaces or kitchens in their own households. Although the leader tells villagers that every household must send at least one person to work on the microphone system, which is installed through the New Village Movement to control every village effectively, some go off to sea or wander off for their own work. Some complain about the ways the leader recruits communal labor. The leader and village elders lament, “Even though we have had lots of benefits from government projects out of the New Village Movement, what with cement and loans, we have lost much of the cooperative spirit which the government is trying to instill.” But, the government ordered projects are not usually suited to the schedule of the villagers’ work. Because villagers know that some of the government work is paid for, they want more direct rewards for their labor, even in regard to such government projects. The compulsory government project thus begins to disrupt the villagers’ work schedule and inhibits the cooperative spirit of voluntary participation for communal labor through the principle of reciprocity."																															587	No	"Since the job is fairly time consuming and costs money, the average person would not be able to hold the office. Wealth, leisure, reputation, and education are considered prerequisites for becoming a village chief. Age and experience outside of the island are also regarded as important criteria for the leadership position."																															588	No	"Until 1964 the villagers were badly exploited by a rich man and successive village leaders. For more than ten years prior to 1945, a rich and powerful villager, the man named Lee who cut down the village tang forest, had been running a brewery. He kept four concubines including two women who were born in Hamgumi. Frequently he asked the villagers to drink rice wine on credit and let them help themselves. After the drinking was over, he charged a lot of money for the wine and collected interest on delayed payments. The debts accumulated over time and the villagers finally had to hand over their land to him. In 1945 he died and the fifteen sons of his five wives exhausted their fortune quarreling over the inheritance."																															589	No	"Class affiliation is an important factor in selecting village leaders. Most successive village leaders have been drawn from the upper class of a few predominant surname groups. Both the present village chief and head of the village fishermen’s cooperative association are representatives of a powerful surname group. They have strong and competent leadership as well as the requisite education and leisure time to carry out the duties of their offices. With the support and cooperation of both the majority of villagers and outsiders including other villagers and administrative authorities, they have exerted effective leadership in many village self-help and government aid projects as will be seen later in this chapter."																															590	No	"All the progress made under Communist rule has been interpreted as the result of President Kim’s “wise leadership,” an interpretation that resembles the pre-Communist custom of attributing personal success in life to one’s ancestors. Any kind of state assistance is called a gift from the “respected and beloved leader” Kim, and it is common practice to speak of his deeds in terms of paternal love. The new strength of the ruler-subject relationship appears to be a projection of the old father-son relationship in a new social context. Without a long history of social arrangements in which kinship was vitally important, it seems unlikely that the modern conditions of integration based upon a sense of paternalism could have been achieved."																															591	No	"What is important here is the fact that loyalty to the supreme leader supersedes the traditional concept of filial piety to biological parents. Farmers and other workers work harder today. Of course, material gain should not be disregarded as a motivating factor; however, it is noteworthy that participation in the socialist construction is interpreted as repayment of the indebtedness people owe to their “respected and beloved leader.” In recent years, the North Korean mass media have carried an increasing number of accounts of exemplary activities of young people arising from their sense of duty to the state and the supreme leader. Feelings of loyalty to the modern leader seem, in fact, to be considerably stronger than the traditional virtue of filial piety. The very mode of integration through deification of the supreme leader leads us to believe that Confucianism, strongly denounced by the North Korean Communists, has survived in transmuted form. The change is a shift in the principle of social organization from familism based on the father-son relationship to primacy of the ruler-subject relationship, so that integration extends beyond the boundaries of kinship. The nature of the relationship between the people and the head of state is so kin-like, however, that it seems appropriate to refer to modern Communist North Korea as a family-state."																															592	No	"Recent North Korean propaganda is loaded with such expressions as “the happiness of today.” When the improved conditions of people’s lives are repeatedly compared with those of the past, the comparison undoubtedly generates a sense of indebtedness to the socio-political system in which they live. The strong human tendency toward anthropocentrism, however, leads people to interpret the improvements in their conditions of life as the acts of a human leader."																															593	No	"The split between the two segments is related to a division in the leadership of the group. The most visible leader and organizer among the thau Ongs is an elected government official, the Ch'inan li chang (head of the li ). The li chang , Pau-a, is a generous man, giving his time freely to those with questions or problems. Frequently, people engaged in some quarrel would end up in his house, choosing him willy-nilly as their arbiter and expecting him to restore equanimity between them. Nearly always, he was able to do so successfully. In terms of the life goals of most of those around him, Pau-a is a moderately successful man. Relations within his family are reasonably harmonious. He owns enough land to feed his family and enjoys besides the modest income that accompanies his position. In much of the community he is a respected arbiter and confidant. Further, he seems to enjoy his position of leadership. He is at ease and confident when delegating responsibility, making decisions, and sitting as an authority in matters at dispute."																															594	No	"The be segment's active leader in the settlement is a man named Hai-a. Since I lived in Hai-a's mother's house while he was in resi- [Page 24] dence there, I came to know him very well. Sensitive about his failure as manager of a clock factory in Taipei, he had returned to the village a few years before I arrived to live in his mother's house. For a time he tried to make a living by running the brick kiln in the Ong settlement. But after his savings ran out, he was forced to tackle the outside economic world again by working part time in a clock repair shop near Taipei. Despite Hai-a's financial failures, his education is more extensive than most of his neighbors', as is his experience as a businessman in Taipei. Perhaps for these reasons others look to him for leadership, and he seems to feel it appropriate that he should provide it."																															595	No	"Dr. Lou's primary formal task as head of the lineage is to manage the income from the common lands. He collects the rent from the person who tills the land, distributes what is necessary to pay for the corporate feasts, and retains the rest. He also heads the lineage meeting on the fifteenth of the eight month, when the representatives together with household heads from all the fang discuss how surplus funds are to be allocated. He does, in effect, what Hai-a's constitution for the Ong lineage would have the business manager do. Besides managing the corporate income, he is responsible for keeping the written Lou genealogy up to date. I do not know how Dr. Lou came to be the head of all the representatives. He told me he had held that position ever since he took primary responsibility for organizing the rebuilding of the hall in 1926. Other members of the lineage do not seem to resent his leadership but, on the contrary, to appreciate his willingness to manage things and act with authority....In this case, conflict was avoided because the lineage members respected the authority and leadership of the doctor. He is a strong leader because the lineage members and especially the other representatives are willing to accept his leadership. And they are willing to do so because, among other things, it is usually to their benefit. Although following the doctor's dictates sometimes causes inconvenience, as in the case of the ancestral tablet, at other times, as when he paid for the completion of the grave, his actions benefit the group."																															596	No	"Another important aspect of the doctor's leadership is his willingness to act as mediator in quarrels within the lineage. In one incident, he mediated a dispute between neighbors over whether the path between their houses had been made too narrow as a result of the remodeling of one of the houses. "																															597	No	"Another variable that can be taken up at this point is leadership. But first a brief look at the criteria for leadership, those factors that determine who becomes a leader. As Hugh Baker sug- [Page 84] gests (1968: 132), leadership in a small, poor agnatic group tends to be gerontocratic because no members are marked off by special wealth or experience; but in a differentiated lineage, in which some members are more wealthy or educated than others, it is those members who commonly hold the political leadership of the lineage. This fairly simple correlation is well-substantiated by the evidence from Ch'inan. Each of the four lineages has produced at least a few members who have more wealth, experience, or knowledge than the rest. In each case some of these men are the political leaders. Seniority by itself is considered an insufficient criterion for leadership. Preferred leaders are those who “know a lot about things."																															598	No	"Previous studies of local political leadership in traditional rural China have focused largely on the roles of the local gentry. It has been said that there were two types of leaders in rural China, “official leaders” and “lay leaders” (see Yang 1945: 181-92). Official leaders were of lower rank and had less power and influence than lay leaders because they were appointed and paid by the government, and were therefore considered to be government runners. Lay leaders, by contrast, became leaders because of their special qualifications--age, wealth, learning, kin-group status, or personal capacity--and were as a result greatly respected and admired by their constituents (Hsiao 1960: 273).Depicting lay or informal leaders in this way often gives the impression that they were men of merit who, by virtue of possessing socially desirable characteristics, were sought out by their villagers to lead the community. In some cases, such a characterization may well have been very close to the truth; but it certainly cannot be accepted as a complete explanation of the prominence of the local gentry. Members of the gentry became leaders for far more significant reasons than that they were model members of their communities."																															599	No	"In short, gentry leaders in traditional China achieved their positions mainly through their access to administrative power and their ability and willingness to protect and promote the interests of their fellow villagers. Peasants thus looked up to their gentry leaders not merely because they were wealthy and educated, but more importantly because they served as representative mediators between themselves and the administrators who had such a strong influence over their welfare."																															600	No	"Even at the village level, class affiliation is a crucial factor for selecting political leaders. They are almost always drawn from the upper class of pond owners, net owners, and other propertied families. They have sufficient funds to run a campaign and the leisure to carry out the duties of office, as well as the requisite education. The average person would not be able to keep the necessary records, write letters and draw up documents, or communicate as easily with the city officials."																															601	No	"While in most instances these village officials are among the recognized leaders of the community, there are usually in addition informal, nonelected local leaders who are influential in the village and area. Such informal leaders are very often also wealthy landlords, important in their kinship group, and many times wield a great deal of power from behind the scenes. Informal leaders also may be drawn from the ranks of less wealthy men who, by virtue of their education and perhaps age as well as past displays of community responsibility, have gained the respect of the community."																															602	No	"In Hsin Hsiang large numbers of girls wish to attend the classes, and it is the responsibility of the formal village leaders -- the mayor, the village representative, and the village Farmers' Association unit head -- to select the students. However, usually the village leaders wish to avoid any possible conflict or criticism over their choices, and, although some girls may meet the qualifications set up by the association better than others, straws are drawn to determine which girls will attend. The method all too often sends less qualified girls to the classes, and these often drop out before the course is over. Several Hsin Hsiang villagers have complained of the wastefulness of this method of choice, and claim that the village leaders are refusing to assume their full responsibility."																															604	No	"There is little hope of real cooperation once serious conflict has broken out, but there is still incentive to settle--or at least to paper over the conflict, so the parties do not actively hinder one another's aims. The values of face and harmony are also important here. Particularly anyone aspiring to leadership must be able to cooperate, and will lose support if his actions are seen as divisive or a hindrance to others."																															605	No	"But Cin-hieng is neither alone nor without opposition in his role of village leader. Many people feel that he treats people unfairly, dispensing favors to “his relatives” (mostly affines), and being short with others whose connections to him are not so close. There is no one leader or focus of the anti-Cin-hieng forces, but in 1972, the person with the most following was Kou Pou-kim, who represented Jiatian and three other li on the zhen council. Pou-kim was the eldest and most successful of the Kou brothers, and was counted a close cousin by the interior Ongs and their relatives on Back Street. People speaking about the village leadership would often contrast the generosity and good-heartedness of one of these men with the calculating, scheming stupidity of the other. The factions around these men were loose and rather small, and most families in the village managed to maintain reasonably good relationships with both leaders. Political power alliances in Ploughshare, like other social relations, are networks rather than aggregations of discrete groups."																															606	No	"But in a wider Chinese society, as shown so clearly by Ho (1962) and as is obvious even in Matsu, wide-ranging status changes do occur. Matsu leaders, for example, enter politics not only to maintain their high status, but to increase it and, as we have mentioned, often lose it. We must conclude, therefore, that while face can be derived from solidarity, these two goals--one public and one private--of Matsu's political leaders are not one and the same."																															607	No	"Two ultimate objectives or goals motivate Matsu Township political leaders to organize for political purposes. Matsu leaders seek local solidarity or unity, a community or publically-oriented goal. They also pursue “face” or prestige, a personal, privately-oriented goal. More immediate objectives, such as the election of a candidate to office or the building of new classrooms, are but means to these ultimate ends. Ironically, the organizational form utilized by Matsu leaders, the faction, all but makes impossible the attainment of solidarity and frequently leads to a decrease in the “face” of many leaders. In this chapter we first examine these two motivating goals (and consider whether they are one) and then analyze the faction, the most important organizational form in Matsu Township's community political system."																															608	No	"A core leader had considerable influence within his native settlement. People at all levels come to him for advice and help. His suggestions and leadership will be followed. The core leader also has influence in other settlements, especially those which support his faction. For [Page 157] example, Township Executive Huang made a valiant, if unsuccessful, attempt to mediate the tangled Phoenix Settlement (A-NW) temple affair. Core leaders also play an important role in representing the township's interests with the outside, e.g. with the county government or party, the police Branch Bureau, and leaders of other townships."																															609	No	"Being village headman or a neighborhood chief in Tatieh is a demanding job, but confers only limited prestige and authority. The headman makes no important decisions on behalf of the community without the explicit approval of the village council or household heads. His authority is restricted by public opinion, and his activities are subject to public review and criticism. Tatieh's headman came under attack on several occasions during my stay. In one instance he was reprimanded at a meeting of the village council for maintaining community records in a haphazard manner; criticism was initiated by a neighborhood chief of different surname, but others present, some agnatically related to the headman, joined in.Because being a headman or neighborhood chief does not constitute an effective stepping-stone to personal profit or higher political office, these positions normally do not attract better educated, politically ambitious, or wealthier villagers. In my experience, headmen and neighborhood chiefs tend to be relatively uneducated men who enjoy a reputation for fairness, sound judgment, and public spirit."																															610	No	"Since no government official was assigned to Ta-ch'i (except during the short-lived Nan-ya t'ing ), local administration was, as noted earlier, left to such local leaders A . The role of these leaders in the past can be surmised to some degree from the still significant influence of their modern counterparts in local affairs. Leaders are referred to as t'ou - chia or t'ou - jen , roughly translatable as “heads” or “bosses.” Their designation as such, more or less by consensus, is a recognition of their de facto power and prestige in the community. Wealth is the most salient qualification for leadership status, but by no means the only one. Others include structural position in various kin-based corporations, membership in a large and wealthy surname group, age, and ability to articulate various factional and communal interests. It is probable that these same attributes were important during the Ch'ing, but to them one should add possession of an imperial degree, an important additional qualification that greatly enhanced the prestige of its holder, and, at least in some areas, military prowess (cf. Meskill 1979)."																															611	No	"At Pansileika it was my privilege to meet one of the chiefs of the Chukchi (the “errem”). A few generations ago the Chukchi, according to their story, had no chiefs and then it often happened that they used knives or spears when quarreling and that someone was seriously wounded or killed. In order to prevent such crimes, the Russians appointed two chiefs (most likely over the Reindeer-Chukchi nearest the Kolyma), and since then bloody fights have been rare. The chiefs are appointed by the oldest among the Chukchi, and are approved by the Russian Government, but carry no sign of 112 their very limited authority. They are only commissioners to whom the Chukchi bring their quarrels and who may turn the parties over to the Russian authorities if no settlement can be reached. The chiefs also act as middlemen in disputes between Chukchi and Russians, therefore, the honor of the appointment is usually bestowed upon someone who lives near the Kolyma. They are appointed for life but when a chief feels old, he retires voluntarily. One of the two chiefs had just died and his successor had not yet been appointed, so I met only the one who was left."																															612	No	"The headman of the ulus is chosen by the princelings and elders of every ulus, without the participation of the local authorities and without balloting, from among the princelings, elders, or honored clansmen, every two years. But inasmuch as the frequent changing of the headman causes the Yakut an extra burden, it is considered that it would be better to choose the headman for three years."																															613	No	"The nasleg princelings and the ulus headmen have no income allotted to them and receive no salary; on the contrary, the execution of their duties entails great losses for them; [Page 4] 1)the take trips at their own expense on state and community business; 2) when they leave home to go to town or 204 to other places, on errands connected with their duties, they pay their own expenses; 3) officials passing through on duty, lower-grade functionaries, religious and church functionaries, and private persons attracted to the naslegs and uluses for various affairs and personal needs are always given shelter in their houses and receive maintenance consisting of provisions and hay and enjoy rooms and lighting, for which the Yakut consider it offensive and dishonorable to demand payment. Therefore, in exchange for all these expenses, according to an ancient Yakut custom, by agreement among the nasleg and ulus communities, material assistance is given to the princelings and headmen in the form of money and sometimes provision apportioned according to their assumed daily losses. This assistance, although given voluntarily by the communities, is not shown in the estimate of community expenses as confirmed by the authorities, as there is no legal authorization for it. Using this as a pretext, some people who are personally hostile to the princelings and headmen undertake lawsuits, claiming excess requisitions, while others make no such claims. such complaints produce formal consequences, which cause the Yakut extreme pain. To end this situation, it is necessary to have legal authorization for the above-mentioned assistance, leaving the amount to the discretion of the nasleg and ulus communities."																															614	No	"Mental and nervous disorders are rare in Little Andaman. Few natives are subject to epilepsy -- an important matter for the Onge: they consider such people as possessed by spirits who speak through their mouths, and respectfully question them as oracles. Several Onge chiefs, such as Chief Tch[unknown]ot[unknown]a of Tamb[unknown]e-[unknown]e-bui[unknown]e, are apt to go into trances that have all the appearance of epileptic fits. They were elected chiefs on the strength of their epilepsy!"																															615	No	"Before the advent of the new civilization, the Arioto had divided up into at least ten distinct communities, but without any true tribal organization. They respected a form of chief, chosen by tacit consent for his personal qualities rather than by name or by birth-right; but the chiefs acted merely as paternal advisers, to be respected in times of trouble, with no illusions of authority. No one commanded, and none obeyed: all were content to follow the whim of the moment, with no conception of social obligation."																															616	No	"There is some spontaneous recognition of individuals as ‘headmen’ as a result of some generally accepted superiority of physique or discernment, but the concept goes no further than the giving of some weight to their views within the group."																															617	No	"As might be assumed from the results of observations made of other savage races, whose sole or chief occupation consists in hunting or fishing, the power of the chiefs is very limited, and not necessarily hereditary, though, in the event of a grown-up son being left who was qualified for the post, he would, in most instances, be selected to succeed his father in preference to any other individual of equal efficiency."																															618	No	"At the death of a chief there is no difficulty in appointing a successor, even if he leave no son, for there is always at least one who is considered his deputy or right-hand man. As they are usually, on these occasions, unanimous in their choice, no formal election takes place; however should any be found to dissent, the question is decided by the wishes of the majority, it being always open to malcontents to transfer their allegiance to another chief, since there is no such thing as forced submission to the authority of one who is not a general favourite."																															619	No	"Social status being dependent not merely on the accident of relationship, but on skill in hunting, fishing, &c., and on a reputation for generosity and hospitality, the chiefs and elders are almost invariably superior in every respect to the rest. They and their wives are at liberty to enjoy immunity from the drudgery incidental to their mode of life, all such acts being voluntarily performed for them by the young unmarried persons living under their headship."																															620	No	"Though females, like minors (that is to say youths under 18), cannot be chiefs, the former have a similar position relatively among the women, to that held by their husbands among the men of the tribe. A chief's wife enjoys many privileges, especially if she be a mother, and in virtue of her husband's rank rules over all the young unmarried women and such also of the married ones as are not senior to herself. Should she become a widow she continues to exercise the same rights, unless she re-marries, when her social status depends on that of [Page 42] her husband. In the event, however, of the widow of a chief being young and childless, she returns to the home of her maiden days, and is in a measure lost sight of, as she sinks to her former position."																															621	No	"The system of ‘Chieftainship’ does not, in its true sense, seem to exist among the Onges. There are no categorically defined chiefs at local group and island levels. But certainly found are the headmen (not very formally recognised) of smaller groups, not necessarily based upon kinship. The unit is normally a collectivity bifurcated from the main group, especially organised for hunting purpose. This headman caters to the needs of the members of smaller group. The system that such heads are always necessarily recognised at wider level, and that, to coordinate, [Page 85] they have a further head over them does not seem to be in existence. The headman, in fact, is primarily meant to look after petty affairs concerning intra-group life; but if need be, he can be used for resolving inter-group disputes. The position of such heads is neither hereditary nor acquired through formal elections. To recognise a head is something spontaneous, especially when some attention-drawing incidents occur. Age factor is not very vital for headmanship. The man who is physically sound and considered active and witty is picked up. The members of the group start considering his views and regard the same as more than those given by any body else. The headman's views carry weight and are attended accordingly."																															622	No	"The Onges also believe in and recognise another kind of leadership whose background as well as the purpose are different to what has already been stated. This is formed of professional experts in different fields. Their specialisation has given them important position in society. Such people are recognised as professional leaders. Though these men cannot exert as forcefully as the other kind of leaders do, they are esteemed in important position and are rated above an average individual, without any specialisation. Being skilled, such professional leaders fulfil specific purposes. For example Okolai is expert in hut-making; Ketorai in canoe-making and Kanjo in making iron implements. Likewise, there is a Kuvera to look after religious matters."																															623	No	"Besides the respect for seniority there is another important factor in the regulation of the social life, namely the respect for certain personal qualities. These qualities are skill in hunting and in warfare, generosity and kindness, and freedom from bad temper. A man possessing them inevitably acquires a position of influence in the community. His opinion on any subject carries more weight than that of another even older man. The younger men attach themselves to him, are anxious to please him by giving him any presents that they can, or by helping him in such work as cutting a canoe, and to join him in hunting parties or turtle expeditions. In each local group there was usually to be found one man who thus by his influence could control and direct others. Amongst the chief men of several friendly local groups it would generally happen that one of them, by reason of his personal qualities; would attain to a position of higher rank than the others. Younger men would be desirous of joining the local group to which he belonged. He would find himself popular and respected at the annual meetings of the different groups, and his influence would thus spread beyond the narrow limits of his own small community."																															624	No	"The above statement is not quite in agreement with what has been written by Mr Man on the same subject, and what he [Page 46] says is therefore reproduced here. “Their domestic policy may be described as a communism modified by the authority, more or less nominal, of the chief. The head chief of a tribe is called maia igla and the elders, or sub-chiefs, i.e. those in authority over each community, consisting of from 20 to 50 individuals, maicla . The head chief, who usually resides at a permanent encampment, has authority over all the sub-chiefs, but his power, like theirs, is very limited. It is exercised mainly in organising meetings between the various communities belonging to his tribe, and in exerting influence in all questions affecting the welfare of his followers. It is the chief alone, as may be supposed, who directs the movements of a party while on hunting and fishing expeditions, or when migrating. It is usually through his intervention that disputes are settled, but he possesses no power to punish or enforce obedience to his wishes, it being left to all alike to take the law into their own hands when aggrieved. The aryoto and eremtaga in each tribe have their own head chief, who are independent the one of the other. As might be assumed from the results of observations made of other savage races, whose sole or chief occupation consists in hunting or fishing, the power of the chiefs is very limited, and not necessarily hereditary, though, in the event of a grown-up son being left who was qualified for the post, he would, in most instances, be selected to succeed his father in preference to any other individual of equal efficiency. At the death of a chief there is no difficulty in appointing a successor, there being always at least one who is considered his deputy or right-hand man. As they are usually, on these occasions, unanimous in their choice, no formal election takes place; however, should any be found to dissent, the question is decided by the wishes of the majority, it being always open to malcontents to transfer their allegiance to another chief, since there is no such thing as forced submission to the authority of one who is not a general favourite. Social status being dependent not merely on the accident of relationship, but on skill in hunting, fishing, etc., and on a reputation for generosity and hospitality, the chiefs and elders are almost invariably superior in every respect to the rest. They and their wives are at liberty to enjoy immunity from the [Page 47] drudgery incidental to their mode of life, all such acts being voluntarily performed for them by the young unmarried persons living under their headship 1 .”"																															625	No	"Where Mr Man speaks of the “authority” of the chiefs it would be better to speak of “influence.” Of authority the leading men have little or none, but of influence they have a good deal. Should any one venture to oppose a popular chief he would find the majority of the natives, including many of his friends, siding against him. The words “chief” and “authority” seem to imply some sort of organised rule and procedure, and of this there is nothing in the Andamans. Mr. Man also implies that in each tribe there is always one recognized headman, but in reality each tribe may possess two or three leading men in different parts of the country, each with his own following. In any case a man's influence is largely confined to his own local group, for it is only at the annual meetings that the men of other groups come in contact with him."																															626	No	"I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man—and often two, three, or occasionally even more—is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally—though badly—translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village."																															627	No	"“The chiefs known as nokmas and the head men of families assemble in a council called jingma changga [which in modern Garo simply means “to assemble in a crowd”] and endeavor to reconcile all those of the clan who have disputes; for it would not appear that they have a right to inflict any punishment unless a man should be detected in uttering a falsehood before them, in which case he would be put to instant death, more from popular indignation than from a regular progress of justice. Dishonesty or stealing seem rarely to be practiced, and almost the only source of dispute seems to be murder, which would appear to be an ordinary crime. But the relations of the person killed are, by custom, held bound to demand blood for blood, and ought to put to death either the murderer or one of his kindred, or at least one of his slaves. The other family then is bound to pursue a similar mode of retaliation, and the feud would thus continue endless, unless the council interfered and brought about a mutual reconciliation, which it is usually able to effectuate, by inducing the parties to accept a price for the blood that has been split. Although every head of a family has an equal right to sit in their assemblies, the influence of the chiefs, or of one or two wise men usually decides everything."																															628	No	"The Garos live by agriculture. People living in the hills have, as their sole occupation, jhum cultivation; those who have lands at the foot of the hills fit for plains cultivations do as the plains people do. Jhumming is a hard process of hills cultivation; it requires clearance of jungles and sometimes felling of big forests every two years for, the hilly lands and particularly those of the Garo Hills are not fertile enough to produce crops perennially. In this district the hills where jhum cultivation can be raised are known as aking lands; and the hills are divided into hundreds of akings. Every hills village has had a headman who is called aking Nokma and who has a considerable amount of influence over others. It is the duty of the aking Nokma to distribute the aking lands for jhumming equitably amongst the families living in the village under him. While doing so the Nokma keeps some lands for himself and his family also."																															629	No	"The judicial authority of the Garo is based on the institution of Nokma. Nokma looks after the village land as well as members of the village. The village judiciary system started with the a’king Nokma or Songni Nokma and the clan elders of that village. Nokma took the leadership in all village activities and since he was supposed to be a warrior, he was not expected to hesitate to punish the guilty if he suspected [Page 44] a foul play. In the past the Garo principle was ‘blood for blood, head for head’. A villager could not go across the neighbouring village, without fear of being killed by the residents of that village without any excuse. Garos did not tolerate people crossing over from other villages. The physical strength was the determining factor in exercising the authority over each other in those days. That was the reason why the warriors were expected to be powerful, strong and ferocious, and attack on slightest provocation. They attacked strangers with the same alacrity as they would hunt the wild animals. Killings were the order of the day."																															631	No	"(i) The Chief . The chief was the executive head of the state. The office of chief was reserved to the ruling clan of that particular area (ka hima). Representatives of other clans could not be considered for the chieftainship. The ruling clan was known as jait Syiem. The jait Syiem was made up of different sub-clan (kpoh) and families (ki iing). These were important because even all members of the jait Syiem though having a common ancestress (ka lawbei) were not eligible to serve as chief. Only the male members of a particular family from a designated sub-clan were eligible. Among the eligible male members the choice of chief was generally made on the basis of seniority. While women were debarred from serving as chief, eligibility was determined by the candidate's matriliny. In other words, the mother determined who would be the ruler of the state. The system of succession was clearly defined in customary law. The first choice went to the eldest son of the appropriate mother. A chief was usually succeeded by his next uterine brother. In some states, such as Cherrapunji, 12 these brothers in effect served as deputy chiefs (Syiem khynnah). The hereditary office was for the life time of the holder.The chief played a prominent role in all social, religious and festive gatherings as well as in the market place. He was respected by all people of the state and his visits to the villages of the state [Page 15] were marked with due respect. People were always ready to help the chief at any time."																															632	No	"This loyalty to the tribe is expressed through various institutions - the annual hunt, often known as the Santal ‘Parliament’ or ‘High Court’; a local council which comprises the headmen of five villages and is a court of appeal from village decisions; and the village meeting which determines day-to-day affairs. For deciding disputes or village matters, male Santals of the village meet as one. The manjhi or headman acts as president and may often give the meeting a firm lead. But the accepted principle is that no one may overrule any one else, that agreement is vital and that the sense of the meeting should prevail. Santal officials in fact are the servants, not the masters of the village and their role is purely functional. The headman summons village meetings, organises the annual festivals and administers communal property. The paranik or deputy headman collects rents and taxes, and the godet or village messenger is a means of summoning villagers to a meeting. The naeke or priest conducts the sacrifices but only on the villagers’ behalf and even the jogmanjhi, or superintendent of youth, has little independent power. His duty is to prevent scandals and arrange marriages. But if a boy or girl offends against the tribal code, they are brought before the villagers as a whole, and it is these whose judgement settles the matter. At the Mag festival each year, village officials surrender their offices and, although this is mainly a matter of form, it is a pointed reminder that their tenure depends upon the village will. If an official dies, the villagers choose his successor. A member of his own family is normally appointed but in theory there is no bar to the choice of someone else. Within the village, Santals govern Santals."																															633	No	"When a breach of rule occurs, the offender is either seized and brought before the local headman or a complaint is lodged before him. The headman summons the villagers to a kulhi durup’ - ‘a sitting in the street’ - the matter is then talked out, each side putting its case, and finally agreement is reached. If the matter is either fairly unimportant or is capable of being adjusted, the offender is required to pay a fine and in certain cases damages. But whatever is imposed must be paid at once. If it is not, the guilty party is exposed to a form of limited excommunication - pante begar - ‘exclusion from the line’."																															634	No	"The chief official is the manjhi or village headman. In villages where rent is payable by the village as a whole it is the manjhi who collects it and makes payment. All abandoned holdings, and waste land are in his charge. He is the custodian of village property—the communal wells, roads, bandhs and grazing grounds and is empowered to requisition village labour in order to repair them. His duty is to maintain the manjhithan or founder’s shrine and to administer the jaher or sacred grove. If the grove is getting thin and there is no other grove in the village, he must have it planted up with saplings. If a bonga tree dies, he must arrange for the naeke to shift the bonga to a new tree and if necessary, to change the grove. He is also charged with disposing of the dead timber. If the manjhithan requires a new pole, he can allot the wood for this purpose. Otherwise he can allow a member of the village to use it after due sacrifice. Besides maintaining this religious property, he must also see that the year’s festivals are duly performed, that every householder contributes and that in the ceremonies of birth, death and marriage the whole village participates. If sickness breaks out in the village, he must summon a meeting and arrange special sacrifices. When a dispute arises or a tribal offence is committed he must summon the village meeting and preside at its discussions. At the end of the meeting he interprets the sense of the village and announces its decision. Finally if a major criminal offence is committed he must arrest the offender and inform the authorities."																															635	No	"Bitlaha: It means to outcast a Santal from society. This outcasting takes place by the order of the assembled members of the Panchayat. It is resorted to when a Santal woman indulges in sexual intercourse with either a diku (non-Santal) or with a person of the same sept. If any one commits such an offence the headman of the village in question calls his neighbouring colleagues together and informs them of the matter; if the people hold that the case is not proven, then those who started the rumour are severely punished. If it is proved, the assembly gives an order for outcasting and they proceed to carry it out the day after the annual hunt. "																															636	No	"The importance of the headman’s function in Santal society can be explained by the fact of an elaborated judicial code 11 by the existence of assemblies operating mostly at inter-village level, aimed at controlling the headman’s authority. Here, a slight difference prevails among the Munda, Ho and Santal society. The Santal have long forgotten their original megalithic culture and now immerse a few bones of their dead in the river. This symbolical dispersion of the bones seems opposed to the careful collection of village founder descendants in Ho and Munda villages where in multi-clanic villages, each clan has its own range of funeral stones. In Santal society, the final dispersion of the bones — which are, however, kept for a certain time under the family roof — evokes the scattering of the kinship groups. The kinship-based groups are still connected with a place of origin conceptualized as a place from which each group of ancestors came. The origin of the twelve original Santal clans is mythical and the migration of ancestors led to another consequence: the segmentarization of the twelve original clans into 160 sub-clans. This segmentarization is reflected at the religious level where each sub-clan becomes a cult group which identifies itself with a deity and a place of origin. Unlike the other groups, the place of origin is not represented by the village itself (as [Page 11] emphasized in the village founder principle) but is asserted to have been lost and is symbolically represented by an uncultivated spot between the forest and the village. In this case, those responsible for kinship-based cults form a corporate group having authority in secular as well as religious matters."																															637	No	"While we observe that the definition of the priest is still identical in the four tribes, the Santal, with more clan fights, have developed a more segmented clan system: at this stage, the subdivision of the twelve original clans in numerous sub-clans has given grounds for rivalry and factions. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have developed a more elaborate leadership which itself offers locus for contradiction. The institution of headman, though embedded in ritual (the cult offered to the headman’s ancestors who were generally the previous headmen of the village), provides also individual talent: a good manjhi, “headman”, knows [Page 12] how to refer to the Santal judicial code and how to manipulate the suspected culprits through oaths and ordalies. He knows the oratory art which confers on him power and prestige. A good headman, however, is not a man of intrigue. Thus a Santal saying tells us that: “the headman’s wife cannot be a witch”; in other words, the headman enjoys a benevolent wordly power which is the opposite of the shady power of witches, those who, having died by accident, have never become good ancestors."																															638	No	"The village headman, or m[unknown]ańjhi, is the man of greatest consequence in the community. The post is hereditary, and it passes ordinarily to the eldest son of the former headman. When the direct line of succession fails through lack of sons or from incapacity on the part of the natural heir, the office passes on to a brother or near relative on the paternal side. The history of the village is preserved in the tradition handed down concerning the headman’s ancestry. For example, at Sarenga they tell a story of the three brothers who were the founders of the village and divided the village offices between them. Among them Lokhon has acquired the greatest measure of renown, and he is commemorated by a shrine outside the present village. The story is told that he died suddenly, and before the news of his death had spread through the village his spirit took possession of a young man sitting in the courtyard of a house some distance away, and through him Lokhon told the villagers that they were to make a special shrine for him. There is a ceremony at the beginning of each new year which suggests that at one time the appointment of the headman, [Page 8] together with that of all the other officials, was renewed annually, but there is little reality in it at the present day and the post is held for life. He is the spokesman of the villagers in all matters affecting their temporal welfare. In the original settlements it was usual for two or three brothers to start the new village together. The eldest brother assumed the leading position, and all the lands cleared or claimed for the future were in his gift. The cultivable land was divided equally after some portions had been reserved for the officials in recognition of the services they would be called on to perform for the benefit of the community, and the headman received the biggest share of the reserved land. As the village grew, others came to settle. Some became the tenants of the headman, fleeing from the oppression of landlords elsewhere. Others came into the village by marrying daughters of the first settlers. So it comes about that the family of the headman is the most substantial in the village. During the course of years, however, even the headman has in the majority of cases lost his original rights to a non-Santal landlord and has himself become an under-tenant, in spite of which his family has maintained its favourable position in relation to the rest of the villagers. In some cases he has also been able to acquire the rights of other tenants who have defaulted for one reason or another in paying rent. In addition to land, the headman receives other payments which he can use for his own benefit. Thus, when an offender against tribal custom is fined the headman receives a fourth of the total amount. During the spring hunts he receives a part of the flesh of every animal slain by a man from his own village. During the marriage ceremonies he occupies an important position throughout, and when a new bride is coming to his village her father has to pay a rupee to him before the party sets out from her home. At all times he is treated with great respect, especially by the younger members of the community. A marriage party always pays its respects first at his house, and at festivals, when the young men go dancing through the village street, they start outside the headman’s house."																															639	No	"The Headman with the assembly decides all matters of a socio-religious, legal and quasi-legal nature of the village. They are the fountain-heads of justice and custodians of Santal customs and manners, the first court of law both civil and criminal, for the Santal is generally averse to litigation in legally constituted courts, and prefers the arbitration of his village-elders.To go into details, the Headman with his assembly will raise subscriptions for the public festivals like the December Harvest-Home, for religious feasts, and for offering libations to the deities of serious epidemics affecting the tribe. In all cases of marriage and funerals, the Headman and his advisory body must attend. Such ceremonies without them are unthinkable to the Santal."																															641	No	"When the parties are found guilty by the assembly, the Headman, who took cognisance of the offence initially, gets his credit, but if the evidence shows that the accused persons are not guilty, he is himself seriously punished."																															642	No	"The leadership of the tribe, whether social or socio-religious as exercised by the Headman or the Priest, is exercised with due restraint because of the check imposed by the consultative body known as “Mo n re n hò[unknown]r.” Thus Santal tribal judgments have that provision for justice and fair-play which all civilised societies crave."																															643	No	"When the sinakkara titles to Kudawewa and Ulpathgama were first issued the Gamar[unknown]ala owners of the land acted effectively as leaders and the land was cultivated. Now that the original leaders are dead, the land has been virtually abandoned, even though the economic rewards of rice cultivation are much greater than before. Today, because of the lack of leadership, each individual owner has to work his own particular share to the best of his own ability. This necessarily restricts the use of the land to chena cultivation, for proper paddy cultivation requires irrigation and that would mean collective enterprise under a leader."																															644	No	"As headman, he had jurisdiction over Rangama and several other hamlets [Page 127] in the area, including the next village to the south. When he died, he was residing in that village in order to look after the very substantial landholdings he had built up there during his term as headman. Since he was considered a man of wealth by local standards, his daughter enjoyed certain privileges which do not normally accrue to Rangama women. Generally, the wealthier the household, the more likely it will be that work will be so organized as to free members of the family for educational pursuits.They do work a plot for condiments and some vegetables, however. Many of the Dissanayake’s Rangama landholdings are leased by others, and they also profit somewhat from moneylending. Moreover, the death of K.B.P. Dissanayake left them with prospects of eventually acquiring more landholdings in Rangama and elsewhere. During his term as headman, K.B.P. took advantage of opportunities to invest money in land and managed to build up very substantial holdings. As of 1965, he was the largest single landholder in Rangama as well as in the next village to the south. At present this land is still undivided."																															645	No	"Theoretically, we should find ‘effective pavula ’ emerging here as factions surrounding these leaders, for here is the centre of the struggle for power and prestige among the elite of this village. Morapitiyans do engage in a great deal of factional dispute; 6 they quarrel constantly, but they change allies with each issue, and it is quite possible—and it often happens—that the same two individuals play simultaneously the roles of enemies and allies in two different affairs. What remains constant in this context is the structure of leadership. For every dispute, each of the sides is formed around at least one of these four elements of leadership. The leaders remain constant; their supporters change from issue to issue."																															646	No	"The shops also, of course, have a profound influence on the social life of the village. The shopkeepers are regarded as worldly and sophisticated men who are intimately acquainted with the distant life of towns, and they are often accepted as leaders and looked up to by the villagers. The sophistication carries the implication, at the same time, that monetary matters are to be kept distinct from kinship and should be treated in an unsentimental fashion. This is probably the most unpleasant aspect of shopkeeping for the villagers. In small Sinhalese villages, kinship obligations are given great attention. The kin group is a mutual insurance association: the members aid each other in times of difficulty. The shopkeeper who starts his enterprise in his own village soon finds himself faced with impossible demands from his kinsmen. But if he wishes to stay in business, he must disregard the claims for special credits from his close kinsmen, for the final goal of these persistent kinship claims is to erode the kinsman who has become relatively wealthy down to the level of the rest of the family. Unfortunately for the shopkeeper, if he resists the claims, the kin group becomes poisoned with ill-feeling.."																															647	No	"The Village Headman in a Kandyan village is often an influential person. He received a salary of about 125 rupees a month (in 1955), depending on seniority. In Walapane the Village Headman’s area was known as a wasama, and since the villages were large, there was usually only one village in the wasama . In the case of the headman of Terutenne, the wasama (known as the Bolagandawela Wasama ) included some further villages ten miles away, deep in the jungle, like Arukwatta and Korahana. The substantial amount of government financial assistance to the villages, which passed through the Village Headman’s hands, made it possible for him to influence the fortunes of humble families very considerably."																															648	No	"Apart from the Village Headman, who is directly responsible to the government, there are also Irrigation Headmen and important Village Committees in Kandyan villages. The Irrigation Headmen ( Vala Vidane ) were individually elected by the landholders for six different groups of paddy fields in Terutenne (see map 4, chap. 4). These elections were then approved by the District Revenue Officer, and the Headmen chose one among themselves to be chief Vala Vidane . In Terutenne the chief Vala Vidane (T. P. R. Nissanka) was the brother-in-law of the Village Headman and at the same time the chairman of the Village Committee and one of the richest men in the area. Hence one family was placed fairly securely at the controls. The other Irrigation Headmen were poor and uninfluential. The task of these officers is to supervise and coordinate the cultivation of paddy. They receive no salary from the government but are expected to be remunerated by the cultivators at the end of each harvest by the payment in kind of a set amount of paddy."																															649	No	There are two outstanding leaders in the village. They are the village headman and the village abbot. Other leaders are those involved in village activities but they do not stand out as leaders as such.																															650	No	"Kamnan: Mr. Prawat Daoboribun, age 50, has been a Kamnan for 9 years and has been the village headman for village 2 for 19 years. The villagers respect him as a strong and decisive man, reasonable and modern. He is also seen as a fair person when setting disputes between villagers. He has been able to organize labor and build a road connecting the two main roads (Phanat Nikhom-Thung Hiang Road and the Sugar Factory Road). Another road is the road from Thung Hiang to Highway 331. In addition, he was also one of the persons who made the building of the temple possible. His wife is also known to be a religious person and helps in all religious activities. Many women follow her example and join her in various activities."																															651	No	"Not surprisingly, there is little scope for leadership in such a community. The kamnan has the official position of community leader but he has very little influence and is not relied on by the people. In practice, his main role is that of messenger passing on communications between the district office and the people. In an effort to gain the esteem of the district officer and the population, he launched the project of setting up a health station in Khayai in 1969. There was little enthusiasm in the population however for better health services were available in the town close by. To build the health station he obtained the support of some more wealthy villagers who at least out of vanity chose to associate their name with the project as benefactors."																															652	No	"The kamnan was still young at 41 years of age for a man in his position which is usually given to an older man. His father who had considerable stature in the community was kamnan before him. When he became too old to fulfil his functions, the villagers chose his son to replace him in spite of his youth and the fact that he was not a phuyaiban. This was done out of respect for the father, to make him feel that he was still important. The kamnan was wealthy by local standards but the wealth was parental wealth. The family had more than 300 rai of land but it was still under the control of the old mother. Some was given out in inheritance. The rest was rented out or given to sons and daughters to cultivate, but the income derived went to the household as a whole. The kamnan was also more educated than average having completed secondary education to the level of mathayom 7 (=MS 4). Today he is the acknowledged leader of the area and respected by villagers of all ages. Every year at the occasion of the Songkran festival they come to pay their respects by pouring lustral water on his hands. The villagers respect him because of his leadership qualities and because of his concern for their welfare as manifested by his record. The fact that he was officially invested in his position by the government helps but that alone does not suffice without the other qualities."																															653	No	"The leadership that emerged from this community reflected its character. It is doubtful that this population would submit to a strong authoritarian leader as in Thap Nam. Effective leadership was exercised rather by persuasion by someone who could communicate convincingly. Qualities that were valued in leaders were the ability to serve the community and bring benefits to it. For example, a good kamnan or phuyaiban should be able to relate to government officials at the district and province level easily, represent the interests of the people and obtain cooperation. The need for literacy had become more apparent since the introduction of several non-traditional agicultural and credit associations for requests and reports had to be written out and accounts kept. As leadership was exercised through these associations, a villager who could read and write had more likelihood of being in an influential position. Seniority and membership in large family groups made it easier for someone to be voted into a position of leadership but did not provide authority of themselves. Likewise, wealth alone was not sufficient to achieve leadership but people considered that it was easier for rich people to assume the responsibilities of leadership for they could afford to be generous, accept duties, and sacrifice themselves for the common good. [Page 72] A progressive farmer was not seen as a leader because of that. He had influence because others followed his example seeing the good results of his methods, but that was not the exercise of positive leadership qualities. Some people were able to force villagers to conform to their wishes because of threats and violence. One large family group in Ban Chung which was notorious for gambling, boot-legging, AA, [Erratum: this should read “bootlegging”. Cf. errata sheet, introductory p. ii, Category 128—Analyst]and fighting, had a bad reputation in this respect. The exasperated villagers had had more than enough of this kind of influence of recent years so that a quality they looked for in their leaders was then good moral character and devotion to religion."																															654	No	"A further consideration on item by item examination shows the following facts: the most frequently chosen item by male respondents was (4) “always to offer your employees full opportunities to discuss freely their difficulties or problems”; the second was (2) “to respond willingly to personal consultation of employees' private matters”; and the third was (6) “to listen to opinions, desires, and propositions raised by employees always with pleasure.” The items chosen by female respondents show an approximately similar pattern, [Page 84]Table 13 characteristics of “desirable leader”[Page 85] except (4) and (2) were in reversed order. The other two items of even number response categories were: (8) “not to alter the arrangement of a task without mutual agreement”, and (10); as for the former item, 14% of the male respondents chose it and 7% of the female respondents did the same. As for the latter item, only 5% of male and 4% of female respondents chose it. The unexpected result shown in item (10) seems to have been caused by an inappropriate Thai translation which had a connotation of P-function, against the author's intention. Therefore, it can be interpreted that the low percentage of item frequency for this category means rather the respondents' preference of M-type leaders."																															655	No	It is evidenced from the above analysis that the villagers have a strong inclination toward M-type leadership. They want to be leaders who first think of the unity of the group and have consideration for their employees.																															656	No	"Clearly, station in the hierarchy improves by amassing greater resources for distribution. In accordance with one's reputation for generosity and managerial skill in making benefits more enduring, one's group grows or withers. Thus to increase status, one may first, through personal diligence, accumulate resources for broader distribution. At the same time the system offers a second manner of rising, for a man of lower station often cannot hope to increase his resources independently: he may offer his services to another with resources greater than his own and redistribute the resulting benefits among his own following. A village headman can, perhaps through his own resources, hold his kinsmen, but to hold the entire village may require his rendering services to the circle headman ( kamnan) and perhaps also to the district officer ( naaj amphoe). The additional benefits received from these higher officers, for instance as work opportunities for his villagers, can be distributed by the headman to secure his position."																															657	No	"To describe adequately the Thai social scene requires a calculus of movements rather than an appeal to geometric concepts. As we have already seen, groups under a leader vary in size and stability; those rising in the hierarchy become larger and more stable. In turn, size and stability depend on the economic resource ready for distribution. Hence, a primary rule of social movement [Page 1253] may be stated: As groups grow in resources, they grow larger and more stable. Conversely, as resources diminish, groups dwindle in size and stability."																															658	No	"People build in certain adaptations to this uncertainty. To each other everyone is outwardly polite, even light-hearted, but they are rarely frank. Because the other person is superior or inferior, he must be treated circumspectly, particularly if he is a stranger, for he may become the source of some advantage or disadvantage. 1111 Phillips' (1957) sentence completion data suggests latent distrust toward other people in the juxtaposition of good and bad qualities: e.g., What I like about him is: he loves us truly; he really helps us; he does not help us with his mouth only. My friend is one who: has the same outlook as I have; he does not betray me. What I like about him is: he knows how to work for a living; he is not a trouble maker.Go to end note pageEven those of long acquaintance may not be trusted implicitly, for they too may lead one to catastrophe. From this atmosphere arises the Thai proclivity to maximize the harmony and pleasantness of meeting others: it is well to avoid debates and best to keep the topic amusingly light. Because of unseen dangers, a leader ordinarily avoids giving benefits to strangers, and a potential member of a group must be introduced by a known person. Similarly, a liaison between superior and inferior once established needs continual validation, be it merely through the smile of a servant or the commendation of a master."																															659	No	"On the other hand, a certain young man of twenty was held in such high esteem that he was encouraged to run for village headman. He gained his reputation by helping others, working hard, never spending time with girls, never drinking, smoking, or chewing betel. However, the youth turned down the invitation to run because he felt that he would be ridiculed and his requests would go unheeded because of his age in relation to the ages of the other headmen in the district. As a result of this decision he gained more respect."																															660	No	"Since Bangkhuad consists of three separate hamlets each with its its own headman, the only unifying factor in the village is the wat. Although its abbot is the most influential member of the community, it would be a travesty to say that he is the most powerful. Nor can one say that the headmen, as such, are the most powerful. They are chosen as much for their generosity as for their wealth, and therefore do not represent a threat to any of the villagers. The extent to which [Page 69] they exert power lies in obtaining free help from their debtors, but this type of power is also possessed by other wealthy farmers. The abbot, who can and does actually wield influence to his own advantage within a limited range, is checked by his inability to become thoroughly engrossed in mundane affairs. Thus, there comes into play an informal series of checks and balances which militates against any one person obtaining too large a sphere of influence."																															661	No	"Any male in the village who is 21 or older is eligible for the position of headman. According to the villagers, an ideal hamlet headman should be married, for he then commands greater respect; he should not drink in excess or be promiscuous; he should neither gamble nor indulge in narcotics. If young, he should try to act old and dignified. He should attend the wat on all important occasions and on some holy days. The length of time he has been a monk is not important, but he must have served at least three months—one Lenten period."																															662	No	"The hamlet headmen must possess firearms. They are given gun permits, but must supply their own guns and ammunition. In addition to the headmen, there are only five families in Bangkhuad who own guns. The requirements for possessing a gun are 10,000 bahtworth of property (about five raj) and a certificate of ownership. The district officer will then furnish the owner with a permit. During the past few years, permits have been difficult to obtain."																															663	No	"The abbot is undoubtedly the most influential, the most respected, and thus the most important individual in the community. It is true that he is the butt of some adverse criticism, but this criticism always comes from the same people—persons who seek utopian salvation from the wat and who, when disappointed with the reality of the environment, blame the leader. These persons, however, represent only about five per cent of the population. In general, the farmer has a tremendous respect for the abbot, a respect constantly reinforced by frequent visits from strangers from other villages and urban areas coming to him for counsel (both wordly and astrological), cures, holy water treatment and other services. People have come to seek his help from villages as distant as Khorad, 200 miles away."																															664	No	"Teng and his wives sometimes complain of the social and economic disadvantages of his being village headman. He is [unavailable]hao nath[unavailable], the one exercising authority in the village: he therefore has to receive and feed visitors and failure to do so would spoil his name ( sia ch[unavailable] ph[unavailable] ya[unavailable]). Villagers are also the l[unavailable]k b[unavailable]n, children of the house or settlement of the headman and so can claim his help. Consequently, in addition to time spent on his duties he is obliged to provide food for any visiting officials, something which normally involves the slaughter of at least one of the household's chickens and a trip to the market to buy vegetables and other ingredients for a curry. Villagers short of food may also be allowed to pick some vegetables grown on the houseplot or perhaps borrow a little rice. Inevitably the headman is expected by the District Officer and villagers to contribute freely to various charitable appeals and merit-making ceremonies.From the headman's point of view the official payment of a monthly stipend of one hundred baht is scant compensation. On the other hand, there are certain advantages such as the prestige attached to the post and the services that can be claimed from the village in return for his work as headman. There are, in addition, various small gifts, services and occasionally substantial payments from individual villagers given in recognition of his help or in an attempt to influence his actions. The latter are generally kept secret as are the odd sums which might be received as ‘hush money’ or in return for taking business to a lawyer when villagers are involved in court actions (cf. Ch. 7: Marketing). Teng claimed that it was the headman's duty to help villagers even at the risk of ignoring or acting contrary to his formal obligations. However, in the most striking cases in which he had not co-operated with the authorities in informing against supposed offenders, the ones so protected also happened to be related to him either directly or through marriage. Consequently the situation is difficult to evaluate, all the more so as one is dealing with little more than hearsay instead of hard evidence about certain events and those involved."																															665	No	"Even though there is a difficulty in evaluating the headman's role in this and similar disputes, the value of the protection that the headman is thought capable of providing may well explain the actions of two men who frequently present small gifts to the headman's household or perform personal services. Wi, the Chinese, (house 49) often sends fruit or vegetables, reputedly because he is afraid of officials on account of being an alien. Plang (house 34) who is a recent immigrant to Hua Kok also occasionally brings gifts or performs services like collecting goods from Wang Thong for the shop. Another way in which he has attempted to consolidate his position is by the adoption of kin terms in addressing the headman though his claims to be related are doubted by the latter (cf. Ch. 3: n. 13)."	0																														666	No	"The causes of disputes brought before the headman during fieldwork ranged from malicious gossip to marital quarrels and theft. Teng never takes the initiative but waits until the matter is brought to his attention by one of the parties involved. He then normally acts upon the request and calls the other disputants to a hearing. Sometimes, however, all he is requested to do is to note the complaint in case the plaintiff finds it necessary to take action at some later stage. Occasionally the affair is such that he attempts to dissuade a would-be plaintiff from pursuing the matter."																															667	No	"This general type of leader-to-follower, patron-to-client relationship is, of course, found in cultures around the world, and the reader might well ask what is peculiarly “Thai” about it. The outstanding culture-specific aspect about it, I believe, is the surprisingly tentative and changeable nature of the relationship. While the patron-client relationship is culturally defined as the way to get things done, and while social behavior in terms of such a type of relationship is a stable feature of Thai social organization, the stability of a particular client's relationship to a particular patron is surprisingly limited. At all levels of Thai society, both leader and follower [Page [p.457]] are likely to harbor constant doubts as to the stability and trustworthiness of the relationship. The leader often entertains doubts as to the loyalty of his followers, and fears that they might leave him, or even turn against him. Until the Nineteenth Century, for example, even the King required his officials periodically to drink sacralized water (thˇyy náam) as a sign of loyalty — a custom that becomes more understandable when one ponders the high proportion of kings in previous centuries whose reigns were terminated prematurely by disloyal followers. The follower, too, often has doubts as to whether the leader is distributing sufficient rewards (especially acquisitive rewards) to him, and as to whether these rewards will continue to be sufficient. If these rewards are seen as too scant or infrequent, some of the followers are quite likely to break away and attach themselves to another leader who promises greater benevolence. An essential ingredient in the preservation of the relationship, therefore, is that it be constantly re-validated by frequent tangible rewards distributed by the leader, and by frequent displays of deference on the part of the follower."																															668	No	"In a society like that of the Toradja the character and the attitude of the village chief was influential on the conduct of his subjects: If the Chief is not generous, the villagers tend to be greedy; if he has a helpful nature, then his subjects are also generally this way; a courageous man gives his fellow villagers confidence. This is not surprising where in olden times the village chief was the confidant of all the villagers. We once needed two bearers in a village where there was a helpful chief. The latter was away, however, and we therefore turned to another inhabitant of the village with our request. The woman of the house raised objections to relinquishing a couple of her slaves, but the man of the house cut her off with the words: “Of course we shall give a couple of bearers, otherwise the Chief will reproach us again that nothing can go well if he is not at home.”"																															669	No	"It has become evident in various ways that the Toradja has good mental ability. This is shown by the structure of his society before the interference of the West; the rules for social life completely satisfy the simple demands that are put upon the society. We have known various wise chiefs who led their people in an intelligent way. When schools were opened, it immediately became apparent that the Toradja children, boys as well as girls, can learn well and that their interest extends beyond the village. A noteworthy phenomenon among them is that many children lose their quickness in learning when they have reached puberty. Among children who did not attend school until they were older the results achieved were not attend school until they were older the results achieved were not the same as among the younger ones."																															670	No	"The social life of the Toradja is based on reciprocal returns. If he goes to help another in the field, he does it with the expectation of being helped in turn later. If one has given someone something, then one can rightfully count on a return gift. If one had contributed to a bride price, the recipient was then bound to do a like service for the helper on a future occasion. This custom was sometimes abused. Sometimes one gave a gift to a member of another tribe under the pretense of sealing a friendship, only to ask later for a gift of greater value in its stead. Therefore the Toradja were reluctant to accept gifts from strangers. When a commission visited Central Celebes in 1897 in order to ascertain the political conditions in this country, gifts were distributed to the Toradja chiefs. Most of them, however, declined to accept them, out of fear that through this the Government would be granted some kind of right over them. Others let themselves be persuaded to accept them by immediately giving something else in return for them."																															671	No	"As a counterpart to this we take the former Chief of Poso, who never did anything for anybody else. Once when he was threatened by To Pebato, he sent a message to the highlands for help. A meeting of Chiefs, at which we were present, was just taking place. The request for help was coolly received, and no one made ready to grant it. An old Chief remarked to us: “That’s the way it goes with people who have nothing to spare for others. No one has any desire to help them.”"																															672	No	"Still another quality came into consideration in choosing a Chief: The Toradja in general are irresolute. So many interests have to be considered, those of the living and of the dead, of kin-group members who can take care of themselves and who can not or can no longer do it, that one must ponder long and slowly before one can come to a decision. People respect one another because they are afraid of one another. Someone whose interests have suffered thinks of revenge in order to restore the balance in his disturbed mind. Therefore people are wary of one another. For [Page 170] that reason they often did not dare to make a decision in matters in which superiors were involved, because they did not dare to take the responsibility for it. They liked to put the responsibility on someone who did dare to do this, and therefore the person most capable of making decisions was the obvious man for Chief."																															673	No	"In no case did concepts of heredity or high birth come into play in deciding the selection of a chief. In small villages of a few hundred inhabitants every adult knew which of them was best suited for this position; it was always the one “whose stairway was the smoothest,” i.e., the one who had the greatest rush of people who needed him. By this alone he was marked out for Chief. But when a villager preferred to entrust his problem to the Chief of another village, he was free to do so."																															674	No	"The task of the Chief thus consisted of consulting with the family heads about matters that concerned the entire village: distributing the land, giving or attending feasts, arranging a burial, building a village temple, undertaking a head-hunting expedition, sentencing a witch, concluding a marriage, and all other such matters. But the villagers remain free in everything. The Chief had to take into account everyone’s interests and sensitivities, and thus his job consisted of continually compromising, for there was no question of coercion; everyone’s personality remained untouched. Personal peculiarities are always regarded as something that one received at birth. One may not take ill someone’s shortcomings; one has to respect and above all overlook them."																															675	No	"The influence of the Chiefship on the character of the Toradja is not a bad one. First of all he is forced to be hospitable. The people who came to him to ask for help in their troubles sometimes came from other villages or were strangers passing through, or temporary inhabitants of the village region, or, for that matter, villagers who had their fields far from the dwelling of the Chief. Such visitors almost always remained for a meal or overnight. Most chiefs liked to have guests because it proved that they were sought after, but they did not have them for nothing either. Whoever was not hospitable also then had little influence as Chief."																															676	No	"Bravery was also necessary in a Chief. In connection with the pleading of a case he had to dare to say: “When it goes beyond the bounds, then the sword will no longer remain in the sheath.” And he had to make good his words."																															677	No	"Especially among the Chiefs the idea of caring for others was more highly developed. /116/ The ordinary Toradja is an extreme egoist, in a naive, but at the same time in a very narrow-minded way. He considers it the epitome of all worldly wisdom always to seek his own immediate advantage. A good Chief stands above this limitedness. He has learned to care for others without first calculating whether they will show him gratitude. He knows how to force himself to do things which he dreads: to take on disagreeable, tiring, prolonged, desperate matters, to assume responsibility, to inspire courage in the faint-hearted, to bring the stubborn to reason, to calm the quick-tempered. The interests of most Chiefs went much further than their own concerns."																															678	No	"The disposition of a Chief also had great influence upon that of the villagers. By his example, the Chief could make courage, generosity, and helpfulness good customs in his village, and if he led the way in such matters he could also reproach his villagers if they did not follow him. In some villages one could get nothing done when the Chief was not present, for the villagers knew well that their Chief would not reproach them for their unwillingness. In other villages the people knew that the Chief would say: “You know perfectly well how I do things; why do you make me ashamed by not doing likewise?”"																															679	No	"One danger connected with the Chiefship is that the Chief misuses his position and his influence by forcing the villagers to do services for him for which they are not obligated. Through this a sort of tyranny can develop, to which the Toradja often submits, [Page 173] even if grumblingly. If a Chief serves his people, a great deal is done for him. Then, without the usual compensation, they will help him in the cultivation of his fields, in the payment of his debts. There are Chiefs who refer to the time and care that they devoted to solving the difficulties of their followers, in order to force them to grant all sorts of services. If this tyranny is not too oppressive, and above all not coupled with injustices, people put up with it. But if it becomes too bad, then they turn away from him and join up with another, who then appears as Chief as a sort of rival of the Chief. Or if no one dares do this, the people move to a sister village and place themselves under the leadership of the Chief there. Several times it has happened that this tyranny took on such dimensions that an agreement was made with another village or tribe to get rid of the wretch. In the choice of a Chief the possibility of tyranny was always taken into account. Thus the villagers would not readily choose as Chief someone who had many debts with the Mohammedan merchants on the coast, out of fear that he would misuse his influence in order to settle his debts, to which his creditors would all too readily urge him."																															680	No	"It also sometimes happened that a village chief made a name for himself among the other tribes through his clear vision and his wisdom, combined with great daring. Such a person was then sometimes sought as an impartial judge to act as mediator in a dispute between two villages or tribes. Thus at a time when the To Napoe were threatening the village of Mapane, a To Pebato advised that a neutral Chief be chosen as mediator, so that he could bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. He did this with the following little verse ( kajori ):"																															682	No	"All sorts of ruses were used in the hand-to-hand combat. The goat hair with which many shields are decorated was first dipped in water or sprinkled with ashes; then in close quarters the shield was shaken against the enemy, whose eyes were blinded by the water or the ashes which flew from the shield. Or one thrust his shield toward the opponent; if the latter then chopped at it in order to destroy it, it was pulled back so that the other one cut himself in the leg or made a blow in the air, through which he lost his balance and fell. Whenever a Chief fought along with the troop, a number of men always stayed in his vicinity in [Page 479] order to protect him, because if he were slain this would redound to the special glory of the enemy. For this reason, too, the troop never permitted a Chief to fight in the front ranks. The tadoelako, too, if he is a wise man, stays in the background for the time being and encourages his men. Only if he sees that they are wavering does he hurry up in order to help, through which the troop gets new courage."																															683	No	"If people neglect to shorten the teeth or circumcision, then the children of the neglectful ones experience the bad consequences of it. If a Chief sins, then often the people have to suffer for it. All shortcomings are punished here on earth. Through undergoing the punishment, the sin is atoned for, and hence there is no retribution for the wrong in the Hereafter. Only shortcomings in relation to the tribe, for which one is accountable to the ancestors, are punished there."																															684	No	"According to the testimony of several old Toradja, in the old days a man never married more than one woman. It may be a relic of this custom that a man with two wives does not mourn over one of them upon her death. Be that as it may, this much is certain, that in more recent times among all Toradja tribes many men had more than one wife, and there are now still some with two wives. Usually it is village chiefs who permit themselves this luxury, but we also knew several slaves who had two wives. Polygamy is called mokaradoea , “to have a second (wife)”; however, this word is also used for those who have more than two wives. Two wives is the number occurring most frequently among the polygamists, though there are also men with three and four wives. The Toradja themselves cry shame upon these last-named cases."																															685	No	"They ascertain whether someone’s life is still present or not; in the latter case he must soon die, even though at the moment he feels healthy. Leaders ( tadoelako ) of a troop of warriors claim to be able to look at young men who want to go along into battle and see whether they will remain in the battle, then return from the expedition unscathed."																															686	No	"It is self-evident that this distribution does not always proceed peacefully; many times someone lays claim to a piece that another person has had his eye on. By giving and taking the leader tries to satisfy everyone. If the house father has neglected to go with the leader for the distribution, then he must be satisfied with a piece that is added to the distributed terrain; his field then does not have a favorable position, for it lies completely on the outer edge of the complex, so that his land is most exposed to attacks by animals, particularly the monkeys that live in the forest bordering his field.Sometimes quarrels about the distribution of the land are brought before the Chief, whenever the fellow tillers cannot mutually agree. 27 As a rule they submit to his judgment. The distribution takes place for only one planting season, and the complainer can be satisfied with the hope that the following year somewhat more consideration will be given to his preference for a certain piece of land. It might also be the case that someone is feeble on his legs and is thus compelled to choose a flat part of the terrain; in such a case another person will abandon his preference for that piece, but he will also make it clear that he is “kindly inclined” towards the other person, and on occasion he will then also demand from this other person one kindness or another, if necessary with a clear reference to his own goodness. People go out of their way for the wishes of a smith, because they need his help, and they comply with the wishes of a hunter in the hope that he will give them a nice piece of his hunting booty."																															687	No	"The leader positions his men in a long, curved line, and thus they move across the field, making holes in the ground to the right and to the left and in front of them, more than a foot apart. While planting in the nawoe lamoa, they may not have a chopping knife belted on them. The leader walks in the middle of the row and sees to it that the men proceed evenly, so that no slot is missed. Now and then he beats (napekadoka) on his dibble stick, so that the work may be finished quickly. At the ends of the wings are placed men who are quick in their movements, because 63 they have to make more holes than those who are toward the middle, since they work toward each other in a curve. When the two groups or the two wings have reached each other, they raise a cheer (mogoemora) . Their thrusts into the ground are accompanied rhythmically by the call of ho! ho! Three people take the lead in this, and the others join in each time. Through this the sticks go up and down evenly. Someone who does not want to go along with calling out this ho! ho! is threatened with a fine. They may not call ho! ho! before an offering has been made to the clearing gods in the morning. Someone also goes around among the men and women with an egg that all must touch. If people ignored this, the gods would raise a whirlwind (lompioe) ."																															688	No	"The crowd of women also have their female leader, usually the wife of the owner of the field. She is careful to have the planting women always on her right side. She gives directions as to where the different kinds of rice are to be planted: the places of the fast and of the slow growing types must be so arranged that one can harvest the former with one’s face turned toward the east without turning one’s back toward the still ripening ears of the latter. They also speak of courageous and timid kinds of rice: the former are planted close to the edges of the field, the latter more toward the middle of the field. If these differences were ignored, then the plantings would not thrive, for the timid rice would hear about all sorts of things and be frightened by this"																															689	No	"The night before they went down to the seashore, the men had to stay away from women, for otherwise the salt that they made would not want to harden, but would fall apart (maboentasi) . Each group went under the leadership of an experienced saltmaker. If a village did not have such a person available, then they ranged themselves under the leader of another group. "																															690	No	"The position of the village chief ( kabosenja ) was not hereditary. The man who best combined the qualities of courage, eloquence, generosity, organizational talent and resoluteness was accepted as such. When a chief began to get old he was not immediately replaced, but was helped by a younger man who gradually took over his duties and usually replaced him when he became too old or died (I, 114). The chief did not rule; his job was to consult with the family heads on matters which concerned the village as a whole. He did not give orders, but could only persuade (I, 115). Although the chiefs had no authority outside their own villages occasionally one of them distinguished himself by particular personal [Page 7] qualities and thereby enjoyed a certain degree of influence over several neighboring villages (I, 117f.)."																															691	No	"Still another figure with a religious function was the head-hunting leader ( tadulako ). His job was to act as intermediary between the men and the anitu, the ancestors primarily concerned with head-hunting (I, 259ff).A raiding party from a single village had a single leader, tadulako, who directed the whole operation. Larger groups usually had two leaders, one who directed the raid as a whole and a second one who led the actual attack. Sometimes a village chief went along, but then as the second leader. Most of the leaders of both kinds, however, were slaves. The tadulako was treated with great respect while in function and everything was done for him. He was responsible for all the members of the group and had to abstain from eating certain foods, doing certain things and using certain words while in enemy territory (I, 259ff.)."																															692	No	"Ultimately every person is thus the member of an adat community the continued existence of which is believed to depend upon his behaving in accordance with its accepted norms and sanctions. When a person is the victim of a transgression, he is expected to minta adat , “to ask for adat ”, meaning, specifically, that he is expected to insist upon compensation in accordance with the stipulations of adat (cf. Heppell 1975:318). The responsibility of the longhouse headman and other community elders is to see to it that correct fines and ritual sanctions are applied and every act of redress is looked upon as a triumph of adat that restores the social harmony and spiritual health of the adat community."																															693	No	"The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order."																															694	No	"A basic factor shaping traditional adat was thus the lack of a hierarchical political order and leaders having at their disposal the organized force to impose their decisions on others. Each regional group, or “tribe”, consisted of a set of autonomous longhouses linked to one another by cognatic kinship, as a generally endogamous collection of overlapping kindreds. When disputes [Page xv] arose, they could only be settled by longhouse consensus, supported by the judgment of community elders, or through the workings of the kinship system. When members of different longhouses within a region were in dispute, each side was represented by influential kinsmen, acting as arbiters and go-betweens. Both within and between longhouses the existence of an unwritten, but highly codified body of adat was of utmost importance in this regard, providing an established, locally accepted basis for composing differences. Moreover, the authority of adat was upheld by belief in its moral correctness and, in many instances, by forms of ritual redress and notions that supernatural punishment follows upon disturbance of the adat order. But ultimately settlements had to be accepted, and mutually acceded to. If differences could not be composed, either the parties involved had to accept the situation or one of them might resort to force, physical retaliation or forceable seizure of property. In such situations a grave danger always existed that internecine violence might result. Faced with this danger, longhouse and regional leaders sought to restrain the parties involved and press them to accept negotiation or submit to ritualized conventions such as diving ordeals or contests with wooden clubs. Between different tribes, no such mechanisms existed for settling disputes, and at this level a state of intermittent warfare prevailed."																															695	No	"Betempoh was, in contrast, a public contest. It was resorted to in cases of boundary disputes between neighbouring communities, in which neither side would voluntarily agree to withdraw its claim. The matter was settled by a fight in which the two sides were permitted to use only wooden clubs instead of spears and swords. The side that lost the fight was forced to withdraw its claim and the contested land was awarded to the victors. Leaders of the two sides were required, as a precondition, to pledge jars to compensate for deaths or injuries incurred by their followers, and the contest itself had first to be sanctioned, and was under the strict supervision of regional leaders. In the Saribas major leaders sought traditionally to avert betempoh because of the danger that people might be killed and actual fighting break out. The historical data that Mr.Sandin cites here suggests that their efforts were usually successful."																															696	No	"Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals."																															697	No	"The headman and other elders must take care not to give advice that is contrary to adat , because any decision that they make may be used as precedent for settling similar disputes in the future. In offering counsel they are expected to cite the rules of adat that fit the case and, taking into account intent and possibly other factors bearing on the case, specify the fine or other sanction stipulated by these rules. A common saying in the Saribas is that, “by using the staff of adat ”, the tungkat adat , symbolized by the staff formerly sent out by the Penghulu to summons litigants to his court, “one is able to stay on the main path”, that is, in the path of right conduct. Thus every legal judgment should be faithful to the principles of adat . That these principles continue to work, despite the rapidly changing nature of Iban society, is itself evidence of the continuing respect in which adat is held by the Iban, the comprehensiveness of its principles and the considerable judicial skills possessed by contemporary Iban leaders in applying them to the varying conflicts that arise in everyday life."																															698	No	"Because of the importance of augury, any man traditionally aspiring to leadership within the community, as a longhouse headman or senior family head, or within the wider region, as a war chief, migrational leader, or the head of a trading venture, was expected to possess a proficient knowledge of augury. The position of the tuai burong was traditionally one of considerable influence in Iban society and a knowledge of practical augury was an important requirement of leadership more generally."																															699	No	"The principal guardian of customary adat is the longhouse headman, or tuai rumah . Most longhouse headmen are descended from the pioneers of past migrations who originally settled the area in which the community over which they have authority is located. The responsibility of the headman is to look after the affairs of his anak-biak , or followers, and, as a matter of course, he is expected to know every aspect of customary adat . If a dispute is referred to the headman, he will attempt to settle it with the help of the Tuai Umai or Tuai Burong (the farm leader or augury expert, respectively), and other village members who are well versed in customary adat . The Tuai Burong is an expert in various kinds of augury as well as being well versed in the genealogies and history of his community."																															700	No	"In other words, every leader attempts to resolve disputes in such a way as to assure a maximum degree of consensus between the principals involved, and, if the matter is a petty one, that is “a small thing”, he seeks, through private meetings, to make it “nothing”, and so avoid public litigation. "																															701	No	"In earlier centuries, when a dispute over land arose between different communities, and neither side would voluntarily agree to withdraw its claim, the matter might be settled by a fight in which the two sides were allowed to use only wooden clubs. This conventional contest was called betempoh . The side that lost the fight was compelled to withdraw its claim and the contested land was awarded to the victors. Although only wooden weapons were used, these contests were serious affairs. If a man was killed during the betempoh , the leader of the party to which he belonged was required to compensate his family with a valuable jar. This was one of the reasons why a successful leader in the past had also to be a man of wealth. Jars were formally pledged before the contest began and a leader's followers or hired champions would join his side only with assurance of compensation."																															702	No	"The betempoh required long preparation and was conducted under strict rules. Before it could take place, the contest had to be sanctioned by all of the leaders having authority within the larger region in which the contesting communities were located in order to prevent it from developing into open warfare, particularly should deaths result. These leaders also determined the time and place of the contest, negotiated the precise terms of its outcome, witnessed the agreement of the two parties to these terms, supervised and judged the contest itself and enforced strict compliance with the terms of the contestants' prior agreement. Despite these safeguards, the likelihood of blood-shed and the possibility of internecine warfare arising from a betempoh were clearly recognized and leaders in the past sought to persuade the disputing parties to submit their claims to mediation, rather than resort to combat. As a result, very few actual cases of betempoh are known to have occurred. "																															703	No	"Intelligent Ibans are anxious to be respected by their countrymen during and after their lifetime. In order to obtain respect, a man should be kind and just in his dealings with other people. He should be diligent, adventurous and brave in all that he does, in order to become a trusted leader."																															704	No	"After a man is married he may become a crew member on a trading boat which sails to foreign ports to trade. After he has gained property by such trading, if he is just in his dealings with his trading mates, he is likely to be elected by others, as he grows older, to be the leader of such a venture. On accepting leadership, he must learn seriously the arts of sailing his own boat and the diplomacy he will need in contacting peoples in foreign countries. If his first and second trading ventures are successful, then he will be known as nakoda , if he has sailed to Brunei, Sabah or the Philippine Islands of Palawan and Mindanao. If he sails his boats even further, to New Guineas, Celebes, Java, Sumatra, Singapore or the Malayan (now Malaysian) states, he is called penghulu prau pelayar (Penghulu of the sailing boat)."																															705	No	"After leading a few kayau anak wars he may be entrusted by his followers with the leadership of an invasion of their enemy's territory with larger numbers of fighters. After he has led his warriors to fight in a major expedition, his status is elevated to the rank of tau kayau . From his success in leading these battles he would be acclaimed by all the warriors in the country as a great warleader, tau serang , who has the power to declare war on the people of another country and responsibility for defending his country from the invasion of enemies."																															706	No	"According to Sea Dayak custom, this feast, the fifth of the nine stages of the gawai burong , should be held only by an experienced war-leader. Linggir was undoubtedly a very brave man, but he was young, and certainly far less experienced than Uyut, his father. "																															707	No	"When land disputes arose among the ancient Ibans, it was frequently the custom to settle them by having a fight in which the two sides used wooden clubs only. These were nonetheless often serious affairs. If a man were killed in one of these fights, the leader of the dead man's party had to pay compensation to the family of the deceased. This was one reason why a successful leader had to be a wealthy man. If it appeared that he might not be able to pay such compensation, people would be reluctant to follow him."																															708	No	"Throughout generations, the Ibans have paid great respect to their longhouse headmen, local chieftains and those who lead them during the farming season. This is due to the fact that when there are matters and problems affecting their community, these leaders are the people whom they can consult to find out whether there is any opposition, or in the case of new projects, to determine whether they are acceptable or not."																															709	No	"Their leaders, as well as enjoying the high regard which their subordinates show them, reciprocate by respecting the people under their jurisdiction; listen to their constructive ideas; show their sympathies to those who are ignorant; and allocate sound assignments to those who are capable of performing them. Should the leaders and their subordinates choose to preserve this practice of respect, the Iban community will eternally enjoy the meritorious qualities which they have inherited since time immemorial."																															710	No	"Before a man can be appointed as the leader of a war expedition he must show his chivalry, and that he has been entrusted by his predecessor as a chief's bodyguard to lead his men to war expeditions or invade others' lands. He must also be conversant with omens and dreams that can be used to lead his men in the expeditions before the people can acknowledge him as their leader. Lacking these qualities, the people will not share the same boat with him or will even totally refuse to go on war expeditions under his leadership."																															711	No	"Wives of these heroes should also try to excel other women in various skills. Without these qualities, they could neither have the position to receive the human heads which their husbands hunted (if they have no blankets which they themselves wove), nor could they become leaders of other women if they are bad, greedy and jealous. All women who are married to such prominent persons should, therefore, initiate good deeds in order to match with the courage and qualities of their husbands."																															712	No	"Conversely, the very success and prestige of the great pioneers, warleaders, and farmers depended on their ability to maintain a solidary and cooperative group of followers and associates. In the Iban scheme of values, individual achievement was inextricably linked with the ability to inspire and organize collective action. The likelihood of attaining a high degree of cooperation was enhanced by the fact that group members aligned themselves with a particular leader as a matter of free choice and on the basis of shared goals (Freeman 1981). In addition, groups were usually small and linked by ties of kinship to the leader."																															713	No	"With reference to the evolution of the Iban legal system he states that “the ultimate concern of all Iban leaders and indeed of all Iban is the preservation and continuity of the group, whether it be a longhouse group or the wider society of a river system.” He observes that"																															714	No	"A pioneering group was organized as follows (Sandin 1967, 1970; Heppell 1975; Freeman 1981). An accomplished male with a reputation for leadership and military prowess would announce his intention to migrate ( mindah ) into new territory and invite other households, usually linked by ties of kinship, to join him. If he commanded the support of a sufficient number of households he would become the [Page 9] migration leader ( tuai mindah ) and almost invariably the war leader ( tuai serang ) of the group. Several other leading warriors would act as his generals or “fighting cocks” ( manok sabong ). Once such a group had staked out a claim to a region ( menoa ) the migration leader would take on the role of regional leader ( tuai menoa ) and continue to exercise authority over his followers with respect to the settlement and defence of his domain. Under his direction the original group would progressively disperse into separate longhouses, each led by a loyal general, and proceed to clear the forest for farming. Later arrivals in the region would approach the tuai menoa to be allocated a sector of his domain in which to settle and farm."																															715	No	"Recognition, as a successful warrior, was the ideal that Iban men aspired to, a cultural achievement that was endorsed in the myths and legends of headhunting heroes and gods. Great war leaders went by the title of tau serang (lit. “those who know how to make war”), and such men were accorded the highest status and honor among their fellows. In this respect, headhunting provided the means for male social mobility and ascendancy in what was an essentially egalitarian society (see below)."																															716	No	"An egalitarian ethos does not, however, preclude the existence of leaders and status distinctions. But in the Iban case, those who rise to positions of power and influence within the community, do so by virtue of their personal qualities and achievements as individuals, rather than as a result of inherited privilege or rank. In the past such men would have included warrior “chiefs” ( pun ngayau ) 8The use of the term “chief” in this context should not be thought of as implying any form of hereditary leadership and is applied here only in the absence of a better alternative. Such men might have been able to command the following of several longhouse communities, through their exploitation of ties of kinship and personal loyalties.

He adds that “[w]arfare as an institution and its attendant glorification of male aggressiveness thus directly conflicted with the principles of sexual equality and egalitarianism otherwise inherent in traditional Iban society structure” (1978:343)."																															718	No	"In Iban society, the spear ( sangkoh ) is identified with headhunting and warfare, while the weaving heddle ( letan ) stands for their female counterpart - the design and manufacture of woven fabrics ( pua' ). This equation of male headhunting on the one hand, with female weaving, on the other, is found throughout Iban culture. Thus in Iban oral literature, the headhunting heroes of Panggau Libau, marry the women weavers of Gellong, while in real life, women who are skilled in weaving are identified with men who have been on the warpath and who have taken heads. In particular, those women who are experienced in the ritual preparation of mordants used in the dyeing of cloth ( indu' tau' nakar, tau' ngar ) are said to be the female equivalent of great war-leaders ( orang tau' serang ). And just as young men were traditionally not considered eligible for marriage until they had taken their first head, or at least been on the war-path (Leach 1950:70), neither could Iban maidens be properly considered for marriage until they had demonstrated their accomplishments at weaving pua' ’ (Howell 1912:64)."																															719	No	"In this study we have set out to re-examine the significance of headhunting, as a male institution, within the framework of traditional Iban society. In the past, the taking of heads was central to the Iban way of life, providing Iban men with a route to status and authority within the longhouse community. Those who had taken heads were able to celebrate their successes through the sponsorship of prestigious festivals, or gawai , thereby publicly proclaiming their social worth as warriors and leaders of the community. The fact that these festivals continue to be held in the present day is indicative of the once crucial significance of Iban headhunting, and its lasting importance as a cultural institution. In this respect, it may be said that the Iban warrior tradition still exerts a powerful influence over the lives of contemporary Iban males."																															720	No	"Every long-house community also has a tuai rumah or house headman, whose principal duty is the safeguarding and administering of the customary law. Within his community the tuai rumah is the custodian of adat , its juridicial warden and principal arbiter. In all other matters however--political, economic and ritual--his arthority is negligible, and he is in no sense a chief. For neither of these positions is there any rigid dogma of succession: to both any male cognate may succeed."																															721	No	"In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah and tuai burong . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah , or house headman."																															722	No	"During his lifetime a man may acquire high prestige and become an honoured leader, but rank is not inheritable, and there is no institution of chieftainship. Iban society is classless and egalitarian -- and its members, untramelled individualists, aggressive and proud in demeanour, lacking any taste for obeisance."																															723	No	"Although the Iban concern for autonomy is particularly clear in the political and economic spheres, individual Iban do subordinate themselves, albeit sporadically, to the authority of charismatic leaders, when they perceive it is opportune and advantageous to do so. "																															724	No	"There has been some debate about the nature of Iban leadership. Freeman describes Iban society as ‘classless and egalitarian’ (1955,1970) and its members as ‘individualists, aggressive and proud in demeanour, lacking any taste for obeisance’ (1970:129). Commenting on this, Sahlins notes an apparent paradox in the elementary forms of Iban leadership given the success of their military enterprises (1958:312-313). In response, Freeman points to the ‘network of kindreds traversing Iban society’ as an excellent basis for the recruitment of war parties (1961b:213-214), while Brown characterizes Iban war leaders ( tau serang ) as ‘routinized charismatic commissioners’ (1979). Rousseau, nevertheless, asserts that de facto status levels and hereditary leadership exist despite an egalitarian ideology (1980), whereas Freeman attributes the very effectiveness of Iban leaders to their occupying positions by virtue of their personal ability to attract and hold a following, rather than through hereditary or other regularly constituted authority (1981:37-42). Freeman characterizes these leaders as ‘men of substance and prowess in action’ (1981:40), who secured the support of the gods and, thus, the special charisma in the eyes of others, which stemmed from this ‘numinous potency’ (1981:41). He insists, however, that such men were, in ordinary social contexts, no different from other Iban and were addressed and treated accordingly (1981:23-24,41-42). It seems, then, that the achievement-oriented Iban both seek and follow effective leadership as and when the occasion demands it, yet remain ‘freedom-loving and autonomous’ (Freeman 1975:286) in response to the ‘egalitarian ideology ... that lies at the heart of Iban identity’ (Murray 1981:40)."																															725	No	"A Dyak house really is a village. It is comprised of several families building together under one roof. There is a chief in every house or village who rules his followers with fatherly tenderness. The position of a chief is most honourable but most difficult to fill. His influence is just as great as his expenses. His room is generally in the centre of the house or village, and he lays the foundation of the house or village first. He is responsible for all visitors and entertains them."																															726	No	"Leadership within the longhouse is exercised by the tuai rumah , headman. Although either man or woman can become tuai rumah , the only female who holds this title at present is Preda. Preda is married and is about thirty years old. Her father was the headman at Tabau, a longhouse at Lubok Antu in the Second Division. Preda was chosen to fulfill her father's office after his death about three years ago. This office is not inherited, however, there are cases when a headman is succeeded by a member of his immediate family."																															727	No	"Ideally , women actively and equally participate in the production of food, in all rituals concerning rice cultivation, in ceremonies, such as giving a young child his ceremonial bath, in weddings, funerals, and conferences [Page 119] conceming leadership and legal matters within the longhouse. Women are not excluded from any part of the rituals, or meetings. In fact, no religious ceremony or conference can take place in the longhouse without them, since certain functions are the women's exclusive domain. According to informants, all important decisions are made by women and men together, and all work is shared between them.Ideally , the key concept in Iban customary law is equality between women and men. This equality also applies to the assumption of leadership in the longhouse."																															728	No	"Although this investigator did not meet Preda, the he adwoman in Tabau longhouse, she paid particular attention to the obedience and respect given to female leaders in all houses visited. Among those leaders were the wives of headmen, and women who were in charge of innovating projects. At no time would this researcher observe any depreciation of the importance of a position because it was not held by a man. In fact, on many occasions men were observed doing jobs normally assigned to women, such as harvesting, tending to pepper gardens, and caring for the children."																															729	No	"Concerning decision-making, although ideally men and women participate together, in reality men and women are equally powerful. This observation is based upon the fact that the Iban live in a classless, egalitarian [Page 125] society. 1Freeman, Report on the Iban , I, p. 54.There is no institution of chieftainship. High prestige and leadership can be acquired, but rank is not inheritable. Another factor is that from the moment of birth of an Iban infant, there is no separation between the child and adult worlds. At no time are children excluded from rituals, conferences, or any event taking place in the longhouse. The third factor is that an Iban husband is often absent from his home, and as a consequence, the women is left in full charge of her family's welfare, of the religious practices, and of the work in agriculture."																															730	No	"The underlying values of bravery ( berani ), boldness ( kempang ), and strength ( kering ) are central to any explanation of Iban aggression, warfare, and headhunting. A man of bravery and strength will have tattoos on his throat, a sign of that he has endured pain, and a headhunter will have tattoos on his fingers (Freeman 1979:238). These values are reinforced through myth, ritual, and the daily division of labor. Bravery may be considered as a means of acquiring status in what Freeman has identified as an egalitarian society. The leader of a longhouse, the tuai rumah, is elected by both men and women of the longhouse for his skills in oratory, warfare, and farming, and his familiarity with adat , or customary law, in order to resolve disputes (Freeman 1970:111ff). Although usually a man, women tuai rumah are not unknown. The tuai rumah must inspire the confidence of his followers and exemplify the qualities of bravery, endurance, and determination that are essential for survival. Skill in farming and warfare is important in the pioneering context, in which the tuai rumah leads a group to establish a new settlement. The tuai rumah has no authority to command others, but is empowered to resolve disputes through influence and by reference to custom."																															731	No	"Oriented to the independence and achievement of the individual, and to the autonomy of the bilik family, and practicing shifting cultivation with little if any surplus, the Ibans supported no permanent leaders. Leaders ( tuai ) who were recognized were of an ad hoc nature such as the war leader ( tuai serang ), who ratified their positions by their performances. The tuai rumah adjudicated disputes because of his knowledge of the history of settlements in his area and of adat (“customary law”). The orang tau tusut was consulted when marriages were arranged because of his knowledge of genealogies; the lemambang (“bard”) for various gawai was the repository of lore; and the manang (“shaman”) for his ability to handle physical and psychical illnesses. But these and other officiants were in no sense chiefs, nor did they enjoy any power beyond that afforded by the recognition of their constituents."																															732	No	"The status of the raja berani parallels in several respects that of the Melanesian “big man.” 19The modern Iban counterpart is the local politican.Like the “big man,” the raja berani was verbally persuasive. Fluency and cleverness of speech ( landik bejako' ) are valued among the Ibans, and every successful leader at whatever level is an able speaker. Though a man may possess other admirable qualities and enjoy success in farming or business, if he cannot speak convincingly, any aspirations he may have for leadership are likely to go unrewarded. 20In longhouses where the tuai rumah is a poor speaker, a deputy ( mandal ) who is an able speaker represents him in welcoming guests and in helping to handle disputes."																															733	No	"Again, as with the “big man,” the raja berani were highly competitive. There is both resistance to any appearance of submission and reluctance to the surrender of his independence on the part of the [Page 87] Iban, making the acquisition of followers and accumulation of political capital most difficult for the leader. Yet, at the same time, the Iban is willing, even desirous, of giving his support to any leader from whom he anticipates rewards. 21Traditional leader-follower relations were built on exchange of loyalty for booty and heads. Present ones are based on kantau , gifts not infrequently of money.Aware of this, the raja berani built followings through promises of adventure, plunder ( perepasan ) and heads ( antu pala' ). Because of the fragile nature of ties between leaders and followers, the former constantly sought to re-inforce their holds on their anembiak (“followers”). As Sahlins wrote of the “big man,” so, too, the raja berani formerly (and his modern politician counterpart)"																															734	No	"The competition to build and maintain a following exerted considerable pressure both on the raja berani as it does on the modern Iban [Page 88] politician. 23Cf.

His employment was remunerative and he was soon able to redeem the mortgaged rice terraces inherited from his father. He then married a well-to-do girl with several fields of her own, and became a substantial middle-class citizen. In 1907 he was enlisted in the special Ifugao police. These Ifugao policemen hold responsible positions, but Bahatan proved fully equal to the work and soon became the most trusted and capable man at the Banaue station."																															737	No	"It is true that the Spaniards and the early American forces agree in the opinion that the Ifugaos were “bloodthirsty.” However, this tendency is not inherent. Even at its height, headhunting was a matter of custom, designed to establish daring, leadership, and position in the tribe. The more heads a man took as trophies in tribal battle the higher the regard and honor his fellows extended to him. And, of course, headhunting was inevitable as a matter of the will-to-live of the tribe. Yet, because of the American policy of attraction, the Ifugaos soon were induced to put a stop to their bloody practice. As early as 1906, Henry T. Allen, then director of the Philippine Constabulary, could report: “There is no longer any question about the ability of the government to handle the Igorot. Aside from his headhunting, which he is giving up under the influence of constabulary intercession and peacemaking, he is proving himself a loyal and uncomplaining subject.” 16"																															738	No	"As an individual, the Ifugao has a strong sense of personal dignity. He believes in no king or ruler, and he is free to act within the bounds of loyalty to his tribe, obedience to his battle leaders and courage to meet his foes, respect for the aged and veneration for the spirits of his ancestors and other divinities. He expresses his opinions openly even before the council of elders, and if he has the personal qualities, he can rise to the leadership of his tribe, in war or in peace. He can even risc from the status of a plebian to that of a kadangyan, or aristocrat. To do this, however, he must have the chief requisitc: wealth — wealth in the form of land, produce, stock, or in most recent times, money. In the absence of material wealth, he must have distinguished himself in battle, not in treacherous ambush, but in face-to-face encounter with the enemy. On the contrary, the lowest depth of humiliation to which he can descend is to have his head taken in battle by the enemy as a trophy. The body of a man so disgraced is buried in some unmarked spot and his name excordated by the native priests during the burial."																															739	No	"There is, therefore, some antagonism within the village concerning who gets aid from the government agencies. This, along with the different backgrounds of those involved, tends to separate those with fishing interests from those with tourism interests, a crucial distinction as far as the women are concerned since they are, in the words of the tourist officer, “the backbone of the local tourist industry.” The attractiveness of the grants to develop the tourist industry brought outsiders to the village in the years following World War II. Consequently, many of the people whose primary interests are with tourism (and this includes many merchants), are designated as “Outsiders” in distinction from “Locals” whose contacts are with fishing. The factional split is often reinforced by traditional community leaders such as the minister or clerk, whose interests are associated with the support of the locals. Villagers recognize these factions and make “Local” versus “Outsider” distinctions, the implication being that “Locals” have more of a right to local decision-making. Women are not necessarily opposed to fishing but they have a vested interest in tourism, and have found themselves involved in local politics on the side of the “Outsiders.” Therefore, the women often find themselves opposed to traditional leaders such as the minister or clerk.When the church hall needed to be painted and repaired, the minister asked the woman if they would help raise money for the repairs. Since this is exactly the type of thing they do in their voluntary role, the women agreed. They decided to plan events for a year in order to raise the [unknown] 2000-3000 they thought necessary. The first series of “teas” and “raffles” earned them [unknown] 250. It was agreed that the money would be spent to paint the hall. However the contract was arranged with a painter without consulting other painters for estimates. The women saw this as unfair manipulation for patronage by one of the traditional leaders. They therefore decided they had “done their part” and did not hold any more events for the hall fund. Since their “strike,” no further renovations have been made on the hall. Because most villagers live on minimal incomes, they are not likely to donate to causes unless the donation involves a social event in which they can participate. Without the women's efforts and donations of tea, coffee, and sandwiches, it is nearly impossible to raise money. This is one way in which they can refuse their services to make a statement [Page [p.142-a]] about local politics."																															740	No	"This brings us to the matter of leadership within the communities, and differences between mainland and Hebrides. The laird, especially if he is an hereditary one, is accepted as a leader almost without question. He is, as the young men of the estate are, in the Territorials. He goes to camp with them each year, he goes to war with the men of his own place, in the 51st Division or in the Lovat Scouts, and all too often they have died together in battle. The Hebridean joins the R.N.R. and is not officered therein by his own kind, and there are few lairds in the proper sense anyway. Great areas of the Highlands are now lairdless and natural leadership within the townships is rare. As has been suggested in earlier sections, actual leadership may be difficult to find in an unstratified society; the ambitious quality in Western civilization is really foreign to the Gael within the townships, where he does not wish to be different from his fellows. The quality of leadership in such a community, when the leader is one of themselves, is of different kind than that of the laird. It is altogether more subtle, pervasive but not assertive. The organizing outsider, therefore, may be very easily misled and find himself working through the wrong man."																															741	No	"There is no room for the expression of a role of leadership in economic activities. The governing principle of township administration is so-called primitive democracy. All males have an equal voice in determining the acceptance of any policy or action which concerns the group, and unanimous consent is necessary for the adoption of any change. Although each township has an elected grazing clerk and a grazing [Page 52] committee, a legal requirement, these individuals lack authority. They are figureheads whose primary function is to advise the government of the decisions reached by all the crofters who share in the grazing and to regulate the use of the land by self-imposed rights. In townships where the sheep are owned as club stock the clerk serves to distribute the profits from the sale of stock, and he may also keep a tally of the individuals who are entitled to payment for labor in townships where money has replaced customary reciprocity. In any cooperative venture beyond the family level, there is no one who can step forward to act as a foreman. The assumption of this role would upset the basic status equality of the crofters, unless the person wishes to be regarded as an eccentric."																															742	No	"The social life of the village revolves around the newcomers and the landed gentry. In addition to the social circles based upon age, sex, kinship, and religion, the individual belongs to several small groups of friends and, perhaps, a few formally organized clubs. When the native-born take part in the formal activities they do so as participants rather than as organizers or directors. The necessary roles of leadership are left to the newcomers or to the landed gentry. The latter, in particular, are responsible for community affairs, just as the chief and his kinsmen were formerly looked to as the leaders of the people. Occasionally, an influential newcomer gives them able assistance. The influence of the old men is not as marked in the village as in the crofting communities, [Page 58] mainly because there are enough young people to form a strong age grade of their own. The more liberal outlook of the villagers is, however, tempered by the old men."																															743	No	"The class structure has changed several times. It has vacillated between a leveling of socio-economic differentiation and a growing polarity of status. At present there is no local class structure beyond the old polarity of landed gentry and crofters. Those who fall between these groups are ranked on prestige values of long standing. Even though many of the intermediate group would be working or middle class if they lived elsewhere in Britain, on Skye personal factors play a more important role in determining prestige than socio-economic differences. Leadership and political power remain in the hands of the gentry."																															744	No	"This status equality for all of the same sex and age grade leaves no room for the status and role of a leader. 15Cf. Darling and Morley, “The Social Situation,” The West Highland Survey, pt. VI, pp. 24-25.Occasionally, an individual fancies himself as a self-elected leader, but he is always resented by the remainder of the township and his neighbors do not hesitate to show their displeasure. As an eccentric, he is dubbed with a cynical title, such as “the sheriff.” If he can keep himself immune to the taunts and jibes of the people, he is accepted in time or, rather, comes to be tolerated. He gives the people something to talk about. The aspiring leader becomes the subject of numerous jokes. Any human failing he displays is immediately taken as a means to censure him. These are negative social sanctions less drastic than ostracism. I only knew one of these selfstyled leaders. He was a well traveled man and a walking encycleopedia of miscellaneous facts. Walking the hill with him, I was told how Boston compared with Glasgow; how the British fought the Crimean War; how the money they received from the Turks helped Skye during the potato famine; and how the [Page 255] New Zealanders breed sheep and make linen. One might say he knew more about the world than about Skye. He could not understand why so many people made fun of him when he was only trying to help."																															745	No	"In summary, we may say that within the township and on the croft the cultural patterns reveal a fundamental continuity. As of old, status is ascribed. Men have remained [Page 256] the social superiors of women. The aged are the social superiors of the youth and young adults. The father determines how his wife and children will behave as long as they remain under his control. The old man, or men, determine what changes will be accepted or rejected. There is no way to question their decisions, unless one leaves the croft. Still, at the bottom, there is equality. No man can step forward as a leader. We are now in a position to look at the larger social grouping, the neighborhood."																															746	No	"Status Equality within the Neighborhood . The fundamental status equality which we found for the crofters within the township carries over to the neighborhood, but, as would be expected, there is often a need for leadership in this larger group. Let us look at the two neighborhoods which I know best to cast light on the methods employed in the self-election of a leader and the means of expressing leadership as a role. Kilmuir has a Crofters' Club, which was originally formed by [Page 266] a former school teacher. The present sponsor and chairman is his successor. The teacher is automatically rated socially because of his important function, educating the children of a people who value education, and his university background. Further, he is from the Outer Isles and, therefore, is not expected to conform to all the traditional norms. Were he a Sgiathanach he probably would not accept the office for it would conflict with older and far deeper values."																															747	No	"To summarize, there is additional evidence for cultural continuity in the structure of the neighborhood. The extended family, although very unstable and, therefore, somewhat amorphous, is still a reality in the minds of the people. It still has two functions which it must have had in the remote past: seeing that all are cared for and given a decent burial. The ascription of status noted for the township carries over to the neighborhood, as does the underlying status equality and need for unanimous consent. Among the crofters leadership is still undeveloped. The old men can enforce conformity but they cannot lead. Although prestige ranking is developed, in the form of the achieved statuses of ministers, doctors, and teachers, it is significant that, except for the minister in Glendale, all holders of prestige status are [Page 271] newcomers to the neighborhood, if not the island. Let us now turn to Portree to see how important status is in this alien village."																															748	No	"Among the distinctive features which overtly characterize the county people is their ascribed status and role of leadership. Indeed, this is their most important function. As the tacksmen were once the counselors of their subtenants, so today the landed gentry must fill this role which the Sgiathanach from the croft will not assume. Even if a Skyeman here and there feels that the local proprietors would like nothing better than to have all the people behave like serfs, bowing and scraping before them, he expects the proprietors to get things done. In Portree the local gentry form the village council. During the war when they were on active duty, there was no village council. The Skye District Council, which replaced the old parish councils and which, acting as an agent for the County Council, is the only administrative body on the island, reveals a similar membership. In any of [Page 284] the nine election districts where a member of the gentry is resident, he is the people's choice. Otherwise, the post passes to a newcomer, especially a minister, if he will accept, a non-crofter of relatively recent arrival, a returned exile, or an eccentric. The Skye delegates to the County Council are similarly elected. The village of Portree and the neighborhood of Glendale are represented by members of the county people; Kilmuir is represented by a minister of the Church of Scotland."																															749	No	"The function of the landed gentry emerges even more clearly when non-political leadership is considered. We may take the Skye Council of Social Service and the old People's Welfare Committee as examples. The Skye Council of Social Service is dedicated to the promotion of the “general good of the community,” and the assistance of the work of statutory authorities and voluntary organizations engaged in improving education, health, and economic conditions. Although the Scottish Council of Social Service claims this is a product of the people of Skye, it was not a spontaneous development. A retired Registrar General for Scotland was responsible for the initial interest. The Scottish Council seems to have stimulated this interest by securing financial assistance in the initial stages and paying 75 percent of the annual expenses. The local organizers were county people, and their success was due in no small way to the efforts of an officer of the Department of Agriculture. Today the “virile leadership and local followership,” of which the Scottish Council is wont to speak, is to be found in one clique of the [Page 285] landed gentry. The people take relatively little part in any of the activities. Most of the crofters with whom I spoke had only the vaguest idea of the work or the achievements of the council, beyond the fact that the council had instituted Skye Week to attract tourists."																															750	No	"There are numerous Free Presbyterian families far beyond the reach of a minister. All they can hope for is an occasional visit, and there are no missionaries of this sect on the island. Although they attend services at the nearest kirk of the Free Church, doctrinal differences are still important enough in their minds to keep them within the folds of their sect. They were born in it and will die in it. Moreover, despite the lack of a minister in Glendale between 1908-1911, 1913-1920, and 1931-1933, the people are as staunch as ever. At such times one of the elders steps forward to conduct services as he would during the temporary absence of the minister. His ability to fill the role of a spiritual leader fortifies his control and his prestige. "																															751	No	"The class structure, in terms of the whole community, has remained rigid. The county people are at the apex of the prestige status and class hierarchy. They are, of course, members of a group which extends across the length and breadth of Great Britain. In any neighborhood where there is a member of the landed gentry resident, he is always looked to for leadership. In Glendale, a privately owned neighborhood, a nearby landlord is their political spokesman. In Portree the gentry have done more than uphold social ranking based on leadership; they have created and introduced new activities in which they express their role. These are the Skye Council of Social Service, the village council, and the Old People's Welfare Committee. They may be aided by others, but their decisions are the orders to be followed. The gentry [Page 387] maintain their position by intermarriage, by educating their children in England, and by interacting with people of similar status within the community and beyond."																															753	No	"While we are on the topic of status and ranking, let us [Page 388] see what Linton, the most explicit exponent of the concept of status and role, has to say about societies which are faced with changing conditions and disorganization. 15Linton, The Study of Man , pp. 113-131.Linton believes that such societies attempt to develop new social patterns by allowing individual initiative, thought, and competition free rein. They are characterized by a wealth of achievable statuses. With adjustment, ascribed statuses again become common. The conclusion seems inescapable that Skye has adjusted. Perhaps a few additional illustrations will make my point clearer. The crofter who assumes a role of leadership is regarded as an eccentric, someone to poke fun at no less than the village idiot. The crofters' children who find their status too confining must leave the island to achieve status. Some succeed, to a limited degree, by moving to Portree, but they are never free of suspicion. Since the majority of achieved statuses on Skye are left to newcomers, it might be said that the Sgiathanach has selected place of birth as a means to ascribe status. Not infrequently the newcomer's acceptance is followed by his being placed in roles of responsibility in both formal organizations and informal groups. The reader may remember the case of the young man from the East Coast who found himself on no less than eleven committees. In Kilmuir the people are represented on the County Council by a minister and the Crofters' Club is run by the school teacher."																															754	No	"Of the crofters' manner of deciding communal affairs in Uist, Carmichael wrote, in 1884, that these meetings “were highly interesting, as showing the ability of the people, their logical and legal acumen, their readiness of resources and, I can happily add, their invariable courtesy towards one another. There was one regular official known as the constable on whom there lay the chief executive responsibility. When a crofter is elected constable of his town-land, he takes off his shoes and stockings and, taking [Page 131] his bonnet in his hand and bowing low and reverently, he declares on honour in presence of earth and heaven, in presence of God and men -- Am fianuis uir agus adhair, am fianuis Dia agus daoine -- that he shall be faithful to his trust. This simple declaration of office is extremely impressive, though now, alas, becoming obsolete from the fears of the shallow thoughtless and the scoffs of the severely wise. The duties of the constables were to divide a new peat-moss into banks for which lots are cast, to see that every crofter does his share of free labour in road building and repair, to engage herds and the like.” ( Napier Crofters' Commission , 1884.)"																															755	No	"When the conqueror had won the submission of the conquered and secured his livelihood, comfort and leisure by their work, he came in time to bring their interests nearer to his own. Yet whenever the ambitions of two rival chiefs conflicted, the essential predatory attitude remained and either might bring fire and sword against the other's harmless people. Through time, the successive tides of emigration and storms of conquest bridged the contrast of extremes. Not two orders of chiefs and people, but successive strata, with intermixture of blood and of tradition, must be sought in the Isles as elsewhere. Traditional life in so difficult an environment tended to be diversified and to encourage all-round aptitudes in people and chief, their characters having much in common. As to blood, the history of Island Norsemen records the marriage of the new-coming chiefs with heiresses [Page 136] from the old chiefs' families, as in the genealogies of MacDonald of the Isles and the MacLeods. A special feature contrasting with English history is that claims to differences of descent, instead of being maintained -- as between the Saxon and the conqueror of Norman blood -- were fused. Even when the ancestor of the chief was alien to the locality, the people and the chiefs ultimately claimed to be of one and the same descent. Neighbourhood softened the impositions of the hunting herdsman upon his human herd, and the feeling of kinship brought reconciliation."																															756	No	"When they lost their tacks, some of these ‘middlemen’ turned to the growing fishing industry and helped to supply capital and enterprise as curers; their successors were active through the nineteenth century and I spoke with [Page 148] the last of these in outlying villages after 1918. When Matheson purchased the Island in 1844 he left the fishing industry to the curers, great and small. Particularly before most fishermen could speak and write English, the local curers were best fitted to take action not only in marketing but in approaching the Government to aid the construction of piers and harbours. On the whole, their long ties with place and people, coupled with education, made them useful leaders of a community in which leaders were needed to adapt life to a changing economy. Here and there one or two small farmers survive, a little apart from the main townships. Aided by a long cultural tradition, they meet changing times by combining with their inheritance a sane selection of new elements."																															757	No	"In general, few distinctions in social status are found.

An energetic, sociable man in his thirties, he appeared to enjoy the task of visiting the households with information about subsidies, brucellosis testing, and sheep drives, although he described it as an unpleasant chore because of the visibility of the position and the probability of becoming involved with disputes. The clerk provides agricultural statistics for the Crofters Commission, applies for and disperses subsidies, arranges transportation for fencing, sand, and fertilizer, pays contractors, and so on. His most difficult job is to enforce communal participation; all too quickly he will find himself labeled “his lordship,” or nicknamed “the Constable,” his home referred to as the “House of Parliament.” Most decisions are made not by visible leaders such as the township clerk, but by a few invisible community leaders who mobilize public opinion. All decisions are made in the background rustle of discussion and rumor long before a vote is taken in a committee meeting; most explicit decisions are unanimous (see Chapter 5)."																															759	No	"Within the township, most decisions are made in a low-profile, democratic process painfully reminiscent of university committee meetings. To put oneself forward in explicit positions of leadership is to put oneself above one's neighbors; it is a threat to communal solidarity, to the egalitarian code of township life. Nevertheless, [Page 90] the township requires local mediators, people with verbal and literate skills to deal with the elaborate bureaucracy of larger British society. Usually these positions of leadership are filled by individuals who already occupy prominent positions of high status. The schoolmaster and members of the mill owner's family, for example, are constantly being called upon to serve on various committees and boards (the minister, although perceived to be a person of high status, should not involve himself with such mundane matters). But even as they perform these duties, they are criticized for being “toffs,” “too full of themselves.” To take up a position of leadership is to offer oneself up for crucifixion, and many people go to elaborate lengths to distance themselves from the negative attributes of leadership, which can make decision making a torturous, indirect process."																															760	No	"The ability to generate social consensus is an important symbol of leadership. In fact, the best leader is one who is not perceived as a leader at all, but a reliable person who mixes well and can get a ball rolling quietly and without calling attention to himself."																															761	No	"The ripple-starters are those who involve themselves extensively in township affairs, always attending meetings and showing up for projects. With humor, readiness to have a “quick drink with the boys,” and skillfulness in conveying significant information without being seen as gossips, such individuals serve as informal leaders. They do not put themselves forward, but they exert an irrepressible force toward decision making. “You've got to do a lot of talking first.” “Everyone immediately wonders about your motives--you've got to show them that you won't personally benefit.” “You've got to persuade everyone before the actual vote is taken. They have to know that everyone else agrees before they'll risk sticking their necks out to vote.” “You have to talk about it first, discuss the merits of it. You must never ask someone outright what he thinks of it, because he might disagree and then he'll have to stick with what he first says.”"																															762	No	"The isit role implies leadership, although the individual may never issue either order, request, or suggestion. When he is on hand at a crucial moment, it may be his decision as to the timing or direction of a move of the herd or a rearrangement of manpower; or, the solution to the situation may be obvious to all; or, if there is a difference of opinion, each herder acts such that his opinion will seem to have been the wisest. With the subtle threat of countermining ever present, a siida isit could scarcely suggest a plan of action other than that representing a simple consensus. This role compares with the headship role elsewhere in the arctic amongst extractors (hunters, gatherers, fishermen) such as the Inuit (Nooter 1976), and Siberian herders (Bogoras 1930; Czaplicka 1914; Shirokogoroff 1933)."																															763	No	"The individual herder functions on his own initiative and in fluid cooperation with his fellows who will be largely of his own generation. Rigid authority figures are absent, even though by consensus one member -- perhaps the sii'da isit ‘ sii'da headman’ -- may have the command of more general know-how or may own more reindeer. Age is no guarantee of wisdom or respect, and the skills of one's parents are seldom transitive. It is said that skills and personality traits manifest themselves in alternating generations.Even though in reindeer herding a strategic deployment of manpower is critical on occasion, it is ac[unknown] mplished with the most subtle of leadership, or none at all, as each herder knows all operations and where another herder is or might be needed."																															764	No	"The enormous presence of Nils-Anti Gruvvisare cannot be emphasized enough.

He was the last herder to milk regularly in the Jokkmokk region. His influence over the herding authorities was great, and many Tuorpon herders consider that it was largely due to Nils-Anti Gruvvisare that herding policy and law during the 1920s and 1930s were driven to such intensive extremes -- for many, beyond the possibility of compliance under the circumstances."																															765	No	"While the Saameby has been granted a certain autonomy, the tremendous shake-up occasioned by the RNL, as regards the re-direction of goals and the re-distribution of power, has caused new discrepancies between what the Saameby can do and what it actually does do. The underlying social network regulating herder interactions, though influenced by law, changes at its own pace. According to law, if the majority of Saameby members so wish, no special consideration need be given to a family's identity with a specific grazing zone. As the herders themselves have been given the power to make such decisions, however, in many cases they are far more inclined to abide by their own traditions than to push for alterations in keeping with “the economically best way” for the Saameby as a whole. Similarly, the Village headmen, who before had the task of mediating in conflicts between herders or between herders and farmers and answering to the authorities, are now advised also to act as work leaders or foremen, assigning and co-ordinating the herders' tasks. In many Saamebys, a headman who took this assignment seriously would be ridiculed and ignored."																															766	No	"The sijda 1 assumes mutual responsibility in certain matters. When the reindeer herds damage the fields of the settled Lapps, the leader of the sijda pays for it and collects equal amounts from the members. When strange reindeer appear in the herd, they are taken care of, and the owner is expected to compensate later for the trouble thus caused. Often the Reindeer Lapps herd animals which belong to the settled Lapps for a fixed price."																															767	No	"The expertise, caution and foresight whereby the pastoralist of the older generation controlled the growth and welfare of his herds was rendered redundant as herding took on an exclusively predatory form. It was this loss of control which led traditional men to cease further investment in reindeer management, at the same time opening up a career for the kind of man who thrives not on caution but on risk. Changes in the overall herding situation have thus thrown into prominence a personality contrasting vividly with that of the declining smallman reduced to hunting peurat for his subsistence needs. This is the reckless adventurer, identified with that rugged, individualistic and highly competitive form of leadership constituting the style of the ‘big-man’.The contemporary ‘big-men’ of reindeer management are the few most conspicuous of the present generation of active herders, who have accumulated both considerable private holdings and personal prestige, surrounded by a following of active but less outstanding men. Their peura investments represent a gamble in which the biggest men play for the highest stakes, publicly demonstrated in the bidding at auctions. Where the traditional pastoralist accumulated wealth through his control over the reproduction of his herd, the big-man enriches himself through a risky policy of wholesale speculation, mediated not by natural increase but by financial profit. The former was typically reserved and evasive in his relations with others. As extension of social relationships could only lead to dissipation of the herd, he preferred to gloat alone over his amassed fortune. However, under predatory pastoralism, a man's wealth is dispersed in the forest and apparent only in small samples at separations, never in its entirety; whilst in herding activities, the emphasis shifts from the control of discrete herds by individual owners to joint campaigns to drive collections of deer of assorted owners into fence-enclosures. Whereas the traditional pastoralist took pride in the size of his collected herd, the contemporary big-man [Page 70] exults in the success of the hunt: in the number of deer he and his followers have found and brought to the fence, representing a challenge to his rivals. Where the former was an isolationist, the latter invests all his personal energies in expansive sociability, seeking prestige and followers as a leader of herding campaigns. For the big-man, extension of relationships opens up channels for the amassment rather than the dissipation of desired resources."																															768	No	"In associational campaigns, the big-man is the focus of a team of hunterherders, rarely more than a dozen men. He may occupy the position of association foreman, carrying the responsibility of directing operations in the field. Even if he occupies no formal position, he is nevertheless the effective boss in practical herding matters. In order to meet quicklyFig. 16. Age/frequency distributions of men actively involved in herding (above) and those on the unemployment and casual labour circuit (below). Shaded areas refer to non-Skolts.[Page 71] changing and unpredictable situations in the deployment of deer, herding demands flexibility and individual initiative rather than a formal and rigid structure of command. Thus, whether or not the big-man is the recognized foreman, during the campaign he is a leader among peers, whose authority lies not in the formal status but in personal prestige and experience. Other herders look to him for initiative and direction, and by seeking his approval to gain admission to the team, they become his followers. Likewise, the big-man not only becomes a focus of peura -hunting partnerships but dominates in the summer marking, the most important arena for the accumulation and consolidation of wealth in reindeer holdings."																															769	No	"Few men can hope to reach positions of influence in practical herding except under the shadow of the big-man. Anyone attempting to ‘go it alone’ is unlikely to find support and risks personal humiliation. Thus, one man who attempted to collect deer to a separation independently of the big-man and his team was barred from bringing them himself to the fence, and from claiming credit for finding them. In the separation, he was openly prevented from bidding in the peura auction, and during the subsequent festivities, he was beaten up and robbed by the big-man and two of his followers. On another occasion when the same man attempted to stage a separation on his own, he was able to recruit only a motley assortment of redundant older generation small-men who were normally excluded from herding campaigns. The attempt, involving the traditional herding combination of skis and dogs, attracted widespread derision and ended in fiasco: the only deer found in the fence had wandered there by accident."																															770	No	"Big-men claim that their aim is to get as many people as possible along into reindeer management, not to push them out. They complain about the phlegmatic indifference of the small-men, sitting at home reflecting on the past, whilst they themselves are constantly looking to the future, for ever planning new operations and experimenting with new techniques. In the ideology of the big-man, it is his own unflagging energy that keeps reindeer management alive; and in his own personal success and prosperity [Page 72] lies that of the community as a whole. Through his investments he contributes the most to the wealth of the association, and through the initiative and success of his herding operations he brings a share in the rewards and a boost to the morale of his active followers. If in the long run the small-man loses, it is due to his own lack of ambition and enthusiasm, whilst the active may partake in the big-man's prosperity, as long as they accept his dominance."																															771	No	"The pivot between the two systems is the office of association chairman. The chairman must enjoy the trust of the small-men, be a man of their generation without outstanding personal ambitions and interests. At the same time, he must be prepared to bend to the demands of the big-man in practical herding matters, where effective power rests with the latter. Although at the apex of the formal association structure, in practice the chairman has little sway over the course of events, and little authority to influence decision-making. His efforts are concentrated in maintaining his own credibility and the facade of association consensus and unity symbolized by his leadership. His task requires a large measure of diplomatic skill. Whilst remaining acceptable to the big-man, the chairman must not appear to sacrifice his moral integrity as an upholder of association law in the eyes of the small-man."																															772	No	"The second interest was that of dominant or aspiring big-men. Whilst paying lip service in public statements to the vision of their elders, their support for the Skolt cause had little to do with a wish to revive intensive herding methods. Rather, they used the pretexts of ethnic solidarity and respect for tradition to win a decisive competitive advantage over their neighbours, by gaining exclusive control over the summer pastures and separation sites within Näätämö territory, and thereby increasing their fortunes at the expense of both their Muddusjärvi rivals and their fellow Skolts. It is a matter of common knowledge in the association that bigmen and their followers, whilst extolling the virtues of traditional ways and paying tribute to the expertise of their elders, are putting their earmarks on as many calves and peurat as can be found. In order to defend their advantage, big-men depend on the maintenance of ideological consensus on the local level, and on the continued representation of the Skolt cause at higher levels of administration."																															773	No	"In the years after resettlement, meetings of the community assembly appear to have been convened infrequently, largely on account of the growing infirmity of the ageing headman. This man, J, first assumed responsibility for the affairs of the community shortly before the collapse of Suenjel in 1938, taking over from his brother K who, until his terminal illness, had combined the roles of headman and local policeman. Though embodying all those qualities traditionally expected of the headman - conservatism, balanced judgement and intimate knowledge of his people - J was not well equipped to deal with the new problems of the post-resettlement period, which demanded expertise in written bureaucratic procedure rather than wisdom in arbitration."																															774	No	"M's rather pompous and aggressive style is in direct contrast to the reticent and unobtrusive leadership of his predecessors. The exaggerated importance which he attaches to the headmanship, and his overt pursuit of public power, contradict the values of the local community, which accord neither rank nor formal authority to its elected representatives. M is an innovator who has carved out a political role for himself according to his own specifications. As a broker between the Skolts and the government bureaucracy, he is equally concerned to invent ‘Skolt demands’ as to press for their implementation, in order to increase the volume of his business and his stock of political capital. His strength lies in his relative familiarity with official procedure and party political manoeuvre; his weakness in his own decreasing familiarity with the people he claims to represent for, living and working outside the community, he is largely out of touch with its everyday affairs."																															775	No	"The new post comes under the aegis of the ‘Lapp Affairs Advisory Committee’ ( Saamelaisasiain Neuvottelukunta - SANK), a small appointed body of senior civil servants and experts on Lapp questions, which was set up in 1960 to inform the government on matters of policy affecting the Lappish population. According to the regulations, the headman must himself be a Skolt who can speak the language. He is responsible for convening meetings of the community assembly at least once a year, and has the right to attend all the meetings of SANK, on which he is bound to represent the views of the community. He receives a salary of 700 Fmk a month."																															776	No	"What type of contemporary leader is acceptable to the inhabitants of Nordbotn? And what types do we actually find there? In return for the delegation of their authority to him, inhabitants expect their leader to initiate benefits without necessarily being rewarded by them for doing so. Let me amplify. A particular leadership requirement is that of liaison with the external authorities who dispense the economic aid. Moreover, a great deal of the aid is in the form of various projects, not all of which are equally suitable for all communities, and it is often left to local indivudals to find out which project is suitable and to introduce the idea of it to their own community. As to the reward of this leader, it is seen by the inhabitants to be in his ordinary share of the common benefit."																															777	No	"	Indeed, when the inhabitants, or the beneficiaries, have procured the benefit they may remove the leader from the office he held while negotiating for it. This is practically certain to happen whenever it is believed that their leader is securing for himself a superordinate position in the community independent of their grace and favour; and when -- as though there is a causal relationship here for the inhabitants -- they believe he is exercising power to make them do what they do not want to do.	Such curt dismissals demonstrate the expendability of the contemporary leader (a highly valued notion in Nordbotn now) and shelve the question of his status.If, then, the leader regards the status of an office, and possible economic increments of office, as his reward, then he is most likely to be left unrewarded in Nordbotn. Now this is true of some of those who have worked for leadership in Nordbotn, but, significantly, it is not true of all of them. For there are two types of persons among the few in Nordbotn who are willing to undertake contemporary leadership. They are distinguished both by the way they meet the [Page 76] whole problem of distrust of contemporary leaders, and by the reward they seek for their pains. For both types expect rewards."																															778	No	"The freeholder accepts the restrictions placed by the community on rewards of leadership. (He finds part of his reward in the confidence the community places in him.) Thus he may continue in office indefinitely because he does not claim any special status for it; in which case the dependence of the community on him is increased. Nevertheless, he can never take the confidence of the community for granted, but must demonstrate his bona fide intentions at every opportunity. We will see that even his industrious engagement on his own farm and in fishing can embarrass his situation. His main problem here, however, is to get the rank and file in the community to accept the various implications of a purely economic goal and to accept the means necessary for its attainment. Finally, there is the high social costs for the freeholder of failure (i.e. rejection by the community)."																															779	No	"He obtains local office in the first place because it seems that he, better than anyone else, can maintain for the community the necessary relationship with the external authorities. He dares -- to a far greater extent than the freeholder -- to create the need for his leadership; if he stays put in one community it is because he considers he has a chance of obtaining bureaucratic status and financial increment (e.g. as manager of a State-financed project and/or as manager or owner, depending on his own capital resources, of a private economic project). But these are precisely the rewards inhabitants do not wish to dispense."																															780	No	"Authority in neighbourhood relations is face-to-face; it is usually taken for granted and it is naturally extended to any task that confronts the group. (This is ideally the domestic group, but in fact as a work or ritual group it is not always self-sufficient.) The group does not deliberately select a leader but follows the lead of the eldest or the most experienced or even the strongest of the appropriate sex for the task."																															781	No	"The only position is that of preacher and this can only be attained through a consensus of acknowledgement; there is no election procedure for the elimination of rival candidates; a local congregation may acknowledge more than one local-born man as a preacher (as well as others who do not belong to the community). It is worth adding here that the exercise of leadership has often been thrust upon preachers who have no desire for it, and the contrary is also true; there have been those who found in the office of preacher the only available outlet for their natural gifts of leadership. But in all cases, there arise preachers because there already exists a congregation. There is certainly no coercive power relationship in the leadership, but there is always the articulation of the spiritual truths of the congregation by the preacher on behalf of his fellow congregationalists."																															782	No	"Moreover, persons are able to repair personal contracts in the congregation: confession provides a means for reconciliation between persons that is both [Page 134] effective and easily accessible. In the economic associations there is no sure means that can be used by these fishermen of achieving the same. We must note here that oral self-expression is not, and has not been, a cultural value of the Coast Lapp fjord dwellers. They have little oral facility -- the preacher and occasionally a chairman of an association are the exceptions. One is relieved of the embarrassment of self-expression in the congregational meetings for confession is very often made in a near or complete ecstatic condition; and because the individual shows himself as a sinner, the congregation does not pass judgement but affords absolution. In the associations, however, when a person finds himself in disagreement with fellow-members or with the leadership, he is expected to argue his case himself. But he loathes doing this; he is more likely either to submit frustratedly to what he regards as an unsympathetic hegemony or to withdraw his membership"																															783	No	"When the snowmobile was first introduced into northeastern Lapland in 1961-63, the first Skolt Lapps to acquire them were individuals who were more socioeconomically successful than their fellows in the ways I have just suggested. In terms of ownership of material goods and participation in a number of different cash-earning activities, the first snowmobile owners were mainly from the upper quartile of the Skolt Lapp community (Pelto, et al., 1968). This is, of course, to be expected, given the high cost of snowmobiles. The important fact, however, is that the acquisition of snowmobiles conferred additional adaptive advantages on those families who were already becoming socioeconomic leaders."																															784	No	"The Skolt council operates in modern Sevettijärvi, but many of its former functions have fallen into desuetude. The meetings of the council are presided over by a head man ( sijd[unknown] suur or weiv olma[unknown] s ) elected for three years, who acts as chairman of meetings and representative of the community, with very little authority to command others or to make decisions, beyond whatever charismatic power a given individual headman may have exercised. The present headman, (1958-59) Jaakko Sverloff, does not have more authority than many others in community disputes, and in social life he is not accorded any notable special distinctions within the community, though he is singled out for recognition by government officials and other visitors from outside the community. At least in the case of this present headman it appears that hospitality to visiting » foreigners » is an important function of the office."																															785	No	"On many occasions the Skolt reindeer herders must cooperate as they participate in a common work situation. In these cases of working together -- trading reindeer at a lett , roping reindeer at a separation or at calving time, and in tending tethered reindeer -- the individual Skolt generally works basically for himself and by himself, though frequently assisting or being assisted by a neighbor, kinsman or friend on those occasions when more than one person is needed. Such working together is carried out without any formal leadership, usually without noticeable joint planning or consultation, and the work alliances between herders tend to be very fluid, changing rapidly from one combination of men to another as the work progresses."																															786	No	"In spite of their flexible nature, however, the Mountain Lapp sii'dât in Karesuando have a hard core of membership, usually round the family of the Leader, the siidâ-ised . This man will generally be one of the wealthier members of the group who has tacitly been accepted as leader of the unit on account of his proven ability as a reindeer breeder and his acquaintance with the techniques of successful reindeer husbandry. The election of the siidâ-ised is not formal, and his authority lasts only as long as he is able to retain the allegiance of a sufficient number of reindeer owners to make the group an economically large enough working unit, Since an old man who himself takes no part in the day to day activities of the herders will not long retain their support, he usually makes over his authority to somebody else as his strength declines, usually to a son. 23 But such a transfer must be ratified by the other members of the unit, who can signify their disapproval by leaving the sii'dâ . Only two examples of the transfer of authority have taken place in the four years during which I have had Lainiovuoma under observation, and in both cases they were from father to son. In both cases the successors were the most competent herders in the sii'dâ , and the change was unanimously accepted. But in both cases the change was gradual as the old men took a less and less active part in the herding operations, and delegated more and more authority to their sons. At all times the consent of the other members of the unit was essential."																															787	No	"Mr. Pehrson points out that the siidâ-ised is by no means always the wealthiest member of his sii'dâ: of five Könkämä siidât , in only one is he the wealthiest, and in two more he is the third most wealthy, taking as an index of wealth the total number of reindeer owned. 43*Pehrson 1953c, pp. 7-8, 19.In Lainiovuoma the same rule applies, although less markedly: in siidât B, C, E 1 , E 2 and F he is the richest member of the unit; in sii'dâ A the wealthiest person is a widow and it is her son-in-law who is the leader, whilst in sii'dâ D the former ised , and his son, who has recently taken over the leadership, together have the largest herd. Wealth is therefore clearly a contributing factor to the determination of leadership, and in many ways is accepted as a reliable index of the good reindeer husbandman. Another factor contributing to a man's leadership, according to Pehrson, is his central position in the network of kinship ties. 44ibid., p. 13.This would seem to be true of most Lainiovuoma siidât . 45But in siidât E 1 and F for example the siidâ-ised is not the most central person in the genealogical network.Other factors, of lesser weight, are the fertility of the ised's spouse, and his membership of the group of elders of the L[unknown] stadian movement. 46ibid., pp. 7, 13, 16.But of all the qualities which he is expected to have, ability to select the best pastures and other indications of good husbandry are the principal ones. 47Mr. Pehrson says that if he fails the only course open to him is suicide, although the incidence of this is very rare -- ibid., p. 18. I have no evidence at all of suicide from Lainiovuoma during the past century, and I suspect that in any cases of this from Könkämä other motives are to be looked for than poor leadership of the herding unit."																															788	No	"The siidâ-ised is said to have the sole choice as to whether a new member shall be admitted to the sii'dâ , and this is probably more or less true; but in many respects the decision must rest on ecological considerations such as whether the addition to the herd will not make it inconveniently large. 52cf. *Pehrson 1953c, p. 13.It is also probable that the other members of a sii'dâ would threaten to secede if the leader decided to admit a man with the reputation of being lazy, thus forcing him to change his mind."																															789	No	"Local-level politics in U[unknown]zice replicate national patterns on a smaller scale. At the outbreak of World War II, the first anti-German resistance bands in the area included young women communists who were high school students, teachers, and textile workers. Many of these women were killed during the war, and are commemorated in various ways as part of the revolutionary tradition of the town. The textile mill, garment factory, and an elementary school in U[unknown]zice are named after women partisan martyrs. A survey of U[unknown]zice leaders conducted as part of my fieldwork shows that 17 percent of leadership during the early postwar years was composed of women, including offices at the highest regional levels (Denich 1976). 6 However, the proportion of women leaders had fallen to 8 percent in 1966, and none of these had high-level posts."																															790	No	"The true family zadruga was strictly democratic in that its leadership was a responsibility more than a position of power, for real power belonged to the assembly of adult male members. The head only carried out the decisions of the assembly, assigned the job responsibilities and saw to it that they were executed, made sure that all members were properly supplied, kept an eye on their behavior, represented the household at the village assembly and in any dealings with the state, acted as host when there were guests, and so on. He could not undertake any significant purchase, sale, or debt without the consent of the others. The only reward for this position was the respect which he commanded from the members and from outsiders. He occupied the place of honor in the house -- in Dinaric regions he even had a special chair -- which he yielded only to a very important guest."																															791	No	"Some regional characteristics of the rod exist. In some regions each kin group has a chieftain, usually the oldest member of the clan, who represents it at gatherings or assemblies. He is often the moral authority who is consulted for his advice, and he may even serve as a judge or arbiter in the division of property or in the handling of minor quarrels. Among the so-called pe[unknown]calbari (migrant workers) of Ohridsko Drinkolo in Macedonia the oldest male was always established as clan chieftain; he looked after the women and children of those who had gone elsewhere to find employment and would also act as host to visitors and representatives of the government. Upon [Page [p.52]] returning to visit their families, the men would often bring him gifts. In some areas the groups are ranked by the date or year that the rod first settled there, and each one has its own place in the village assembly based upon this order. Each clan is represented by its oldest member. As in the case of the brotherhoods in the tribal regions, the rod may have its own common property which has never been divided by inheritance or which, in some cases, was purchased as a joint venture. In earlier times such common property was more widespread, but even now examples can be found in Herzegovina, the southern Morava Valley, and[unknown] Sumadija, where a rod may jointly own a mill, well, pasture, tract of woods, or other piece of property."																															792	No	"A weaker brotherhood might merge with a stronger one, or a family new to a region might enter a brotherhood, adopt its last name, its traditions, and all its rights and obligations. Since the houses (families) of a bratstvo usually live together, either within a single village or within several neighboring villages, the brotherhood is also an economic unit. Within village borders a bratstvo has its own areas of forest and pasture land, and the tribal lands in the mountains are also frequently divided on this basis. Furthermore, bratstvo members are responsible for materially assisting one another. Such brotherhoods are also legal units within a tribe, for each has its chieftain, the knez (prince), who is usually the most capable or respected representative of the most prestigious or powerful rod . This leadership is often inherited within the same rod or within the same “household”. In Montenegro brotherhoods were also important units in local religious organizations, usually having their own church, their own saint’s day, and their own graveyard."																															793	No	"On the village level, there was the seoski knez, or village headman, chosen by his fellow villagers from among the Council of Village Elders. By common agreement he and the Council assessed the taxes among the villagers. He also exercised all police and judicial functions of a purely local nature. For a group of villages there was an oborknez, a district chief, who in turn was responsible to the Turkish administration, usually to a spahi."																															794	No	"Each subsidiary nuclear family slept in its own vajat summer and winter, without any fire for warmth. In addition, there were numerous other outbuildings for storing wine and brandy, grain, dairy products, and for the various kinds of livestock. Karadjordje, leader of the First Revolt and founder of the dynasty that ruled Yugoslavia intermittently until the Second World War, lived in such a house in the village [Page 24] of Topola (about eight miles from Orašac), now a county seat but then a village of forty houses. He was the wealthiest man in his village and one of the most prosperous peasants in all Serbia. His house was distinguished from the others in that the main building was better constructed, with thick walls, and he had about ten different types of outbuildings. 6"																															795	No	"The village Council of Elders or kmetovi, from among whom was selected the village headman, was composed only of the stare[unknown]sine. [Page 27] The headman acted as the intermediary between the local peasants and the Turks, for collecting taxes and for other functions."																															796	No	"Some of the ideal attitudes of zadruga life as well as glimpses of actual behavior are reflected in the writings of a Serb ethnologist of the early twentieth century, Jeremija Pavlović, who studied [unknown]Sumadija in the period before the first world war. His primary occupation was as a village schoolteacher, and his long residence in the area enabled him to know it well. He observed for this period that, as in earlier times, the stare[unknown]sina was usually the eldest male but might also be an exceptional younger man who was frugal, clever, and honest, who in his work and thoughts set an example for the other members of the household. According to Pavlović the headman was selected on the basis of the consensus of all adult members of the household, although he notes cases of individuals forcefully taking over the leadership. A tyrannical or incompetent elder could instill fear or exploit his position for personal aggrandizement or sexual advantage, particularly if the zadruga were a rich one and employed workers from outside."		0																													797	No	"The headwoman, usually the wife of the stare[unknown]sina, continued to be important. She divided the women’s work, kept an eye on household goings-on so that no one took anything to which she was not entitled, and made sure that all contributed in equal measure to the functioning of the household. The other women were obliged to respect her and to accept her advice about the performance of household tasks. She was supposed to act respectfully to the headman who, according to Pavlović, did not single her out from the other women. In keeping with the patrilineal structure, a sister of the household head could openly criticize an in-marrying woman; on the other hand, an in-marrying sister-in-law or daughter-in-law could speak frankly, in private, only to her own husband."																															798	No	"In Serbia the loosely organized Liberal party was the first to try in the 1860’s to fight the entrenched bureaucracy by leaning somewhat on the political support of the peasantry. But the first real political movement in Serbia giving expression to the political and economic aspirations of the peasantry came at the beginning of the 1870’s. The originator of this movement was Svetozar Marković (1846-75), a socialist, who, while studying in Switzerland and later Russia, became a disciple of the Russian socialist, N. S. Chernyshevsky, and who tried to apply socialist ideas to the conditions of a peasant country—Serbia. Like some of the Russian reformers he thought that Serbian peasantry, by building up on the house collective, or zadruga, could slide into a socialist economy with modern technology without going through the “purgatory of capitalism.” But more important, Svetozar Marković was the spiritual father of the People’s Radical party, established in 1881 by Nikola Pa[unknown]sić, himself originally a disciple of Bakunin, and others (Pera Todorović, Adam Bogosavljević), and based on peasant masses. Soon after its establishment the Radical party became the chief popular political force in Serbia and controlled Serbian political life from 1903 to 1918 and the Yugoslav party political life from 1918 to 1929. It [Page 252] originally became great because of its opposition to state bureaucracy, and by its struggle for political liberties, the rights of the parliament as against the Crown and bureaucracy, local self-government, and improved agricultural credit. This party acquired its great prestige partly also because of its nationalist program and its opposition to the pro-Austrian foreign policy of the Obrenović dynasty. But as soon as the Radical party went into power, as soon as it became a government party, it forgot its propeasant program. In fact, it soon became the main party of the nascent Serbian bourgeoisie, and, what is even more significant, it became the most corrupt party in all Serbian history. Nevertheless, the Radical party commanded the support of most of the Serbian peasants, at least until the end of the 1920’s. This support was maintained by the tight hold of the Radical party machine over the peasants, by the great prestige of its leader Pa[unknown]sić (who died in 1926) and his hold over the popular mind, distribution of patronage, and by the use of credit to peasants as a tool of political control. Of course, after 1918 they used, perhaps more than any other party, the fanning of prejudice of the Serbian peasants against other nations, especially against the Croats and their leaders."																															799	No	"	Articulation of these semi-autonomous households was effected primarily through the institution of the ‘gathering’ ( onmakket), which has continued to play a major role in village social and political integration to the present day. These gathering sessions, which are held nightly in most Kuna communities, are presided over by a governing body consisting of at least three chiefs, a handful of arkars (‘interpreters’), and a varied collection of village elders and politically active younger men with strong voices in community affairs. These men, who are the guardians of tradition and decide both the course of village business and the tenor of moral conduct, meet regularly in a centrally-located ‘gathering house’ ( onmakket neka) to perform and listen to chants dealing with mythological themes or recent historical events, or to discuss village matters. The evening sessions in the larger communities are generally attended only by men, but in smaller communities most of the populace makes an appearance. While the men generally hold their own gathering sessions in the evenings, the women are periodically called, usually two or three times a week, for special gatherings in the mornings during which village leaders instruct them as to how they should behave. The gathering assembly has rightly been called the “heart” of Kuna society (Howe 1980:10), for it serves to stress the integration of the [Page 12] community as a unit and, at the same time, to render decisions on all issues of importance (for excellent descriptions of this institution see Howe 1974 and 1980).	"																															800	No	"Surrounding the ‘gathering’ is a wide variety of ritual specialists, most of whom are considered to be highly important members of the community. Included in this group are shamans, medicine men, curing chanters, puberty chanters, death chanters, and a number of other, lesser professionals. None of the specialties known by these men is mutually exclusive, and a chief may also be a shaman, a medicine man, a curing chanter and/or a puberty chanter; in fact, this is often the case. Stress is placed on the organic integration of these different specialties (see Howe 1974:235-238; Howe 1977), and in their chants and speeches village leaders often spin elaborate metaphors which emphasize this aspect of the “ideal” Kuna community. One of these metaphors likens a strong community to a hill covered with all the major trees, vines, and bushes. At the crest stands a giant ikwa tree, 33 A tall hardwood tree with edible fruit. Dipteryx panamensis (tonka bean tree) (Duke 1968:48). See also Howe 1977: 145-146.which is the first chief; this tree is flanked by other important trees of slightly smaller stature, which are the lesser chiefs, the arkars, and other community leaders; these trees are in turn overrun with vines of all sorts, which are the medicine men and other ritual chanters; the bushes and smaller plants which surround the trees [Page 13] and vines are the members of the community at large, who support the village specialists by their presence and nurture their own moral sentiments at their feet. In the same way that malevolent spirits are held in check in a region well-fortified by “important” plants, evil forces are kept at bay in the Kuna village that is protected by a strong governing body supported by a wide scatter of ritual specialists. 44 Another organic metaphor likens the village to a house: the center posts are the chiefs, the posts along the sides are the arkars, the roof support poles are the ritual specialists, etc. See Howe Ibid.: 154-155."																															801	No	"The second key personality in Putturkanti at this time was a man named Ikwa-ipilikinya. Born in the 1860’s with the innate powers of a shaman, he was generally known simply as Nele (and later Nele Kantule). His father was a highly regarded medicine man, and Nele, who displayed extraordinary intelligence and creative powers, was raised for a career as a ritual specialist. In his late teens he journeyed to the Kuna village [Page 447] of Caimán, on the Gulf of Urabá, where he studied medicines and developed his shamanistic powers under the tutelage of a well-known specialist named Nele Inayoka. After four years he returned to Putturkanti and married; but before long he again set out after ritual knowledge, this time to the inland village of Paya, which was then considered by the Kuna to be one of the centers of traditional lore. 22 A chief from Cartí Suituppu visited Paya in 1975, and was shocked by its cultural decline. He found the village virtually without ritual specialists or chiefs with a thorough grounding in traditional oral history.During the next several decades, Nele continued his travels and studied with specialists in the villages of Arki (Arquía), inside the present territory of Colombia, and Kwipto, where he learned from a man named Jesús Manuel, who had gone to school in Cartagena, Colombia, and was versed in European and Latin American history. By the time Nele ended his wanderings, he had managed to pick up an impressive repertoire of medicinal knowledge, curing chants, puberty chants and accompanying ritual, traditional Kuna legends, and a smattering of Western history. He was now prepared to take his place in the community as a practicing shaman, ritual specialist, and village political leader."																															802	No	"The most important persons in a Tule village are the chief, the doctors, and the ‘official musicians.’ A chief may be also a doctor but the musicians seldom act in other than their own capacity. Each village has four such musicians, two of whom are known as the ‘chief musicians,’ and the other two as ‘assistant musicians.’ [2] These men know all the songs and teach them for pay when requested to do so. The four musicians do not attend the same gathering in their official capacity; thus at a wedding there is one chief musician and one assistant. At social gatherings there is only one singer, who sings alone for the entertainment of the people. He has no instrumental accompaniment, but six men standing in a row play on bamboo flutes during the prolonged tones of the song. Dancing is accompanied by two players on the panpipes, and the dancers often sing and clap their hands.”"																															803	No	"“The work of a Tule doctor is twofold as he ministers to both the bodies and minds of the people. He treats the sick by administering remedies and by such simple therapeutic measures as quiet and partial abstinence from food or drink, singing as he prepares and administers his most important remedies. In addition to this he teaches the young people, ‘beginning especially with the boys when they are very young. He exhorts them to right living, telling them not to quarrel, steal, nor tell lies.’ The Tule say that they have never been at war, and quarrelling among individuals seems particularly abhorrent to them. The doctor, chief and certain civic officials are [12] a ‘court of domestic relations’ which reviews and adjusts complaints. If a wife brings a complaint, this court ‘scolds the husband,’ and if a man leaves his wife, the court forbids him to marry again.”"																															804	No	"“The office of chief is held for life and is not hereditary, though the son of a chief may be elected in his father’s place if he has the requisite ability. After a chief dies, the people meet and discuss a possible successor but a vote is not taken until the opinion is unanimous. Then someone says (in effect) ‘So-and-so is a good man, let us make him chief,’ and all the people give their assent. It is said that a dissenting vote has never been known."																															805	No	"One of the duties of a chief is the instruction of the people in ethics. It was said, ‘The chief holds a meeting almost every night and talks. Him tell people must not quarrel nor say bad words. God say people must not do such things.’ If they do not have a good crop the chief says, ‘It is because you have been telling lies and talking badly. You cannot have good crops if you do such things.’ He also exhorts the people to work hard in the fields."																															806	No	"The traditional congreso was a politico-religious institution. The religious attributes of the chieftaincy commanded considerable respect, and provided legitimacy for political authority in a restricted number of situations. In its religious aspect, the role of chief is paternalistic (in Cuna terms, grandfatherly). 1 As a political institution the traditional congreso was and is a consensus system based upon universal adult male participation and a primus inter pares chieftaincy. Power was in the hands of older males, one of whom achieved the chieftaincy by virtue of his qualifications in terms of traditional learning. In its secular aspect the role of the local chief was and is primarily that of conciliator. The two aspects of the undifferentiated traditional chieftaincy were somewhat contradictory and the system selected for two distinct personality types: the strongly self-confident and [Page -227-] charismatic leader, and the mild-easy-to-get-along-with reconcilor of disagreements. The charismatic individuals tended to compete for leadership at the interisland level. The mild-mannered arbitrators (the majority) became the supporting or secondary leaders within the interisland factions.			"																															807	No	"n every Cuna community several sorts of medical and religio-political figures are found: In addition to the chiefs these are: nele-shamans, curers of epidemics ( apsogets), medicine men ( inatulets), leaders of the female rites de passage ceremonies ( kantules), and death chanters ( masartulets). 22. For descriptions of these roles see Nordenskiöld 1938:44-46, 59-64, 80-89; and Stout 1947:32-33.Go to end note pageTwo other traditional statuses of lesser importance also figure in the political system: speakers (Sp. vocero, Cuna sunmakket) and policeman ( suaripet). Of the major statuses, only the position of chief or saila has culturally assigned political attributes, but the authority of the others is translatable into political influence. If one asks, “What is the political structure of a Cuna deme?”, the answer is in the form of a description of congreso structure and its political role. If the question is, “What is the nature of authority among the Cuna, and what sorts of persons wield political influence?”, then the answere requires an examination of the traditional cosmology and the authority statuses derived from it.The Cuna cosmology rationalized traditional authority of the [Page -230-] several sorts mentioned above. The holders of these various positions are the persons most likely to comprise the leadership group and to exercise influence over decisions in the local congresos. The connection is not a necessary one, and there are always exceptions. However, prestige based upon achievement in any one of these areas is potentially translatable into political influence. It is very unlikely, for example, that the most important medicine man in a community would not also be a man of considerable influence in its congreso."																															808	No	"The old educational system was one of the most important features of the traditional culture with relation to its flexibility. Although any Cuna boy could (and apparently at one time did) undertake studies, whether or not he aspired to leadership in the society, the educational system functioned primarily as a leadership training system. A young man with political ambitions was required to undertake 15 to 20 years of formal study of the Cuna tradition. Although the core of a traditional education was the chants and legends (both religious and medical), [Page -233-] the training also included “how to be a chief.” This latter included the study of the lives of famous chiefs of the past, and of the history of Cuna dealings with nonCuna."																															809	No	"The training of a future chief had two aspects, the transmittal of information and the development of character. The teacher transmitted to his pupils the various religious and historical legends and chants which he knew. At the same time, little by little, he passed on esoteric [Page -234-] information consisting of the underlying meaning of the symbols occurring throughout these legends. Although the pupil paid for this esoteric information, what governed whether or not the teacher divulged it was not money but the teacher’s estimate of the character development of his pupil. The educational system trained for moral and ethical growth as well as for intellectual development and leadership skills."																															810	No	"In the days before the monetization of the economy through the introduction of coconut cropping, the command over manpower which a great chief had because of his 20 or 30 pupils was significant economically. Young men who aspired to be chiefs delayed marriage until 18 or 19, whereas other young men married just before or at puberty. The pupil lived with each of his principle teachers for a period of years. Even after he married and became a minor leader in his home community, he might take a year or more off to study from time to time. He frequently made weekend trips to a teacher. While living with a teacher, the pupil worked as a member of the teacher’s household. Under slash and burn technology the extra manpower would have put the major teacher-chiefs in a powerful economic position. According to the data available, the chiefs were polygynous while nonchiefs were probably monogamous (Stout 1947:78). 88. Apparently polygyny was a chiefly prerogative among the Cuna in the recent past. One older informant mentioned that chiefs in the past were often related. It may be that an important chief had wives in more than one village. According to Second Cacique Olotepilikiña polygyny was introduced by Ipeorkun together with the chieftaincy itself.Go to end note pageThe combination of the institutions of akwedi and polygyny would have meant that chiefly households were very much larger than the average. The switch to coconut cropping placed a premium on land ownership rather than control over manpower."																															811	No	Leaders were chosen from among the older men. Leadership was based upon achievement but younger men did not have access to power.																															812	No	"The chieftaincy was an intermittent, primus-inter-pares status-role. (The chief was not a full-time specialist, and the position did not automatically confer significant power on the holder.)The number of chiefs varied from three to six. The number of voceros varied from four to fourteen or fifteen. The number of native policemen ( suaripeti) varied from none to about twenty. The importance of each of these positions varied considerably from community to community. (Since not every community was surveyed, the numerical ranges should be taken as indications not absolutes.)There were four methods in use for the selection of chiefs:The traditional method, designation of his successor or of a lower chief by the First Saila with public validation of the selection by the congreso. The office was held for life, subject to satisfactory performance of duties.Selection as the result of competition among factions within the leadership group, with public validation of the outcome by the congreso.The religious and secular (executive) functions of the chief were differentiated in many communities, with separate individuals acting as business and singing chiefs. Where this differentiation was found, congreso meetings were consistently differentiated into singing and business meetings. Singing meetings were absent on two islands (i.e., the system was fully secularized)."																															813	No	"Although Nargana women were the most modernized and acculturated in San Blas, they continued to give weight to traditional qualifications for leadership, in particular to the moral reputation of the candidates. It was considered essential for a Nargana chief to be educated and to speak fluent Spanish. The man elected in 1964 qualified under both sets of criteria. He was over 70, had a reputation for morality, and was a grandson of a former saila. He was also well-educated (he was Baptist minister before his election), trilingual and the leader of a local party branch. Although this man had been an innovator in the 1920’s and 30’s, because of his age he did not provide vigorous leadership in 1967."																															814	No	"Kinship is not irrelevant to politics. Kin ties between leaders of different villages sometimes foster special relationships, and over the years a few kin-based networks, mostly involving educated Kuna, have been active in modernization and regional politicking (see Holloman 1969:345-349). The children of famous leaders, moreover, have sometimes enjoyed an advantage in their own careers: in 1984 the intendente and two out of three caciques were children of past regional chiefs. Kinship as a metaphor is used to encourage village and pan-Kuna solidarity."																															815	No	"The overt role of wealth in politics, however (as opposed to possible statistical tendencies), is marginal. In my experience, though senior agriculturalists predominate in higher office, within their age cohort they cover the whole range from richer to poorer. These observations agree, moreover, with emphatic statements by informants that wealth is not a requirement, either acknowledged or tacit, for leadership and influence."																															816	No	"Wealth and exchange, moreover, are excluded as idioms of political action. This by no means should be taken to mean that political economy is irrelevant in San Blas (see especially Stier 1979:103-110). Villages set economic policy. They arbitrate questions of ownership and inheritance. They gather and spend revenue, make economic demands on members, and even compete with private producers and sellers. Chiefs, however, neither redistribute nor personally control public wealth (which may be the case more often than theorists have recognized; see Werner 1980:277-280, 302-303), and neither chiefs nor followers get ahead by manipulating exchanges."																															817	No	"The comparison of chief with sun encapsulates the contradictory nature of Kuna leadership. Like the sun, the chief fulfills a positive, even necessary, function, and his prestige and prominence resemble the sun’s brightness. That same prominence, however, strips him of privacy and subjects him to the strictest moral standards. He works, moreover, at the command of others, both God and his peers, and (at least in theory), he cannot stop, even for a moment."																															818	No	"Kuna enjoy travel, and both leaders and followers find quite a few reasons to visit other islands. Chiefs go on public business (to expedite an application, argue a case, or consult with allies) as well as private (to see friends, study with a teacher, or ask for a donation of smoked fish for a daughter’s puberty ceremony). While a chief waits for fish to be caught or an application to be processed, he spends his days and evenings in the gathering house, talking and singing (see Sherzer 1983:91-95). Ideally he should also travel occasionally just to sing, as did the culture heroes of Kuna history, and quite a few chiefs do so, especially the more learned and confident among them. Whatever his motives, a chief seldom travels alone, sometimes bringing a spouse or child along, more often an arkar or policeman. While abroad in San Blas, he sheds most of the particulars of his village’s internal politics, and as ambassador and embodiment of the chieftaincy, he receives greater deference and privilege than he does at home—his own followers, for instance, would certainly not provide him with three hundred or four hundred fish on request."																															819	No	"Chiefs fill a demanding and trying role, as they themselves are quick to point out. Their followers subject them to scrutiny and criticism and make strong and sometimes contradictory or impossible demands on their conduct and performance. The Kuna make their chiefs public servants, the keystone of the political system, and lightning rods or scapegoats, all at the same time. They exalt the office and knock down those who fill it. All of their actions, both as chiefs and as followers, exhibit the most intense ambivalence concerning leadership and hierarchy."																															820	No	"The men of each village choose their chiefs through democratic or oligarchic election. At the democratic end of the continuum, all the men of a village meeting in open session decide on whom to name or promote as chief. At the oligarchical extreme, a few islands empower a restricted group of notables, sometimes called by the Spanish name gabinete, “cabinet,” to select a chief in a closed caucus, which announces its decision only as the candidate is about to be inducted into office. Most of the islands that make such decisions in closed session later ratify them in the gathering, [Page 81] however, and even women, who are almost always excluded from formal participation in elections, make their opinions known informally. Urwanapirya, my primary field site, oscillated between the two modes of democracy and mixed oligarchy from one election to the next."																															821	No	"Two points concerning the criteria for office should be stressed. First, as noted in chapter 1, wealth does not qualify one to lead. Although demonstrated competence in economic matters may be taken as a sign of leadership ability, and although senior leaders tend to be older men who have come into their inheritance in land, my own observations agree with those of informants from several parts of San Blas that chiefs and arkars vary widely in terms of landholdings and income (cf. Stout 1947:33-34; Costello 1975:118, 147-151, 164). Second, electors give every sign of caring deeply about the character and performance of the men they choose. They may prefer candidates with interests and views similar to their own, but in most cases they are very conscious that the community as a whole will depend on their choice and that a decision that brings divisions within the village into play can only lead to trouble. The qualities electors look for are intrinsic to leadership, and surprisingly often they identify self-interest with the general interest."																															822	No	"Chiefs gain prestige in considerable part through their learning, and, as a result, considerations of prestige strongly color the learning process. The elements that actors can manipulate are how much they learn and from whom, and eventually how much they teach. Each chief strives not only to maximize the value of his learning by seeking prestigious teachers, but even more important, to minimize anything that would imply inferiority vis-à-vis his peers. According to several informants, many chiefs end their studies earlier than they might because they are ashamed to be learning still, or because learning from anyone but the acknowledged greats presents a threat."																															823	No	"The Kuna demand better-than-average behavior from their chiefs in all spheres of conduct. Chiefs, especially first chiefs, should be generous in their personal hospitality, honest in economic matters, and restrained in their sexual conduct. One requirement, however, is most important: a chief should lead a quiet life, shunning conflict, rumor, and argument. Harsh words and disputation are inappropriate outside the gathering, and even in it he should as much as possible speak moderately and calmly, avoiding entanglement in hotly debated issues."																															824	No	"Case 4.1 In the late 1970s on one of my field sites, a challenge to the fitness of the first chief by one of his rivals inspired the men to review the record of adjudicated misdeeds for each of their leaders. The secretaries’ books showed that the first chief, with only two minor problems in the last several years, had the best record of all the chiefs, a result that strengthened his support by his followers."																															825	No	"Villages do, moreover, throw chiefs out for serious faults and sins, even chiefs who otherwise enjoy strong support. I recorded cases of chiefs thrown out for sexual misconduct, embezzlement, drunkenness, and brawling, and others of chiefs reprimanded for lesser faults, such as argumentativeness, competitive status challenges, and suspicion of embezzlement (see Howe 1978b:543, 1974:170-173; Sherzer 1983:100-110). My best chiefly informant spoke vividly about how his closest friend would condemn him if his offense were serious enough."																															826	No	"The tangible rewards of chiefly office are few. For about a decade the Panamanian government paid salaries of sixty dollars a month to first chiefs, but the gobierno revolucionario that came to power in 1968 did away with this practice. According to Prestán (n.d.), a few islands have instituted a more modest monthly stipend of ten to thirty dollars as a substitute, but the great majority of chiefs receive only food and gifts. On their own islands, chiefs and arkars are among the first to be fed at communal meals and household fiestas, and it is my impression that first chiefs are favored somewhat more than ordinary people in interhousehold prestations of uncooked fish. They are treated most generously, however, away from home, where in addition to eating several times a day, they may be sent off with gifts of food, and if they need smoked fish for a chicha, their hosts will provide them with several hundred. Both at home and away, they consume a good deal of the tobacco kept in the gathering hall. In aggregate, these privileges do not add up to very much. The primary rewards of chiefly office—prestige, influence, and authority—accrue in the course of exercising it."																															827	No	"The most significant aspect of giving proper respect to chiefs is negative: one must not show strong anger to them or in their presence (with the partial exception of gathering debate), and one should not speak obscenely or improperly to them or near them (see Howe 1974:176, for a case). (The latter rule, however, depends much more on context and the social distance between the parties present than does the former.) When, for instance, a visiting chief stays for several days and his hosts have a pressing case to adjudicate, they will usually handle it outside the gathering (leaving a notable or two to keep the visitor company) if there is any danger of the proceedings becoming acrimonious."																															828	No	"Other restrictions on chiefly influence have yet to be mentioned in this chapter. The most basic among them is the ability of the majority to over-rule any decision a chief might make; theirs is the ultimate say-so. The Kuna articulate this principle clearly and explicitly, both in Spanish and in their own language, and they follow it rather consistently in actual decision making. 44. They say that things will go “by the say-so of the majority” ( mayoría soketpali) and that “those who sit in greater number defeat the others” ( pur melu pukkwat emarki opinne).Go to end note pageIf a chief disagrees with other village leaders on an issue, he will lose to them, and even if a sizeable minority takes his side, the majority still prevails. Being overruled by his followers differs from a vote of no confidence in a parliamentary system, in that chiefs can be and are overruled any number of times without losing their offices. On the other hand, it hardly strengthens their position to be overruled too frequently."																															829	No	"One corollary of majority rule is that the chief has limited scope to act in the absence of other village leaders. He sometimes finds himself in situations away from home that call for a decision, but his actions will be reviewed when he returns to his village. The Panamanian government has somewhat more authoritarian ideas on this subject than do the Kuna: it officially recognizes only one chief per island, and it often treats him as a strong executive officer, as if he had the right to make decisions independently. In some cases where the government is involved, its view prevails, but more often a community feels free to change a commitment made by its chief, and if community members feel he has maneuvered them into a corner, for instance by signing an agreement without consulting them first, they may throw him out of office. Most chiefs do consult their followers before committing them to anything, and they keep them abreast of the routine administrative matters they have handled. Followers in turn monitor their chiefs’ actions closely."																															830	No	"The ability to overrule chiefs would be considerably circumscribed if followers had to confine their opposition to major issues or if they could contradict their leaders only in polite and indirect language, but in fact the opposite is true. The Kuna believe that anyone can benefit from frequent advice and, although seniors publicly admonish juniors more often than the reverse, orators allude frequently to the right of lesser men to lecture their leaders. Whether the men criticize something the chief has already done (or failed to do), or merely remind him of his duties, they often exercise their right to harangue their leaders in the most direct terms."																															831	No	"More generally, the Kuna tend strongly to restrict the chief’s activities (on his own island) to the gathering house and his own home. They require him to make himself available at one place or the other throughout most of the day, to consult with village members, and to receive strangers and visitors. They do not expect him to stroll through the village and direct activities he comes upon, make suggestions, or interfere in problems. The chiefs I know, and in particular, the two first chiefs with whom I lived, did restrict their movements in the village to a considerable extent."																															832	No	"First of all, a chief enjoys a considerable potential for influence in his position as gatekeeper to the village and the gathering. Visitors and strangers, unless escorted directly to the gathering house, must check in at the chief’s home. Village members and resident outsiders, although they can bring up an issue in the talking gathering without advance warning, are expected in most cases to air it with the chief ahead of time, and in many cases he will introduce the matter into the meeting for them. The chief’s gatekeeping, in fact, forms only one aspect of his position at a principal [Page 95] node in the flow of information and opinion. "																															833	No	"In addition to whatever influence he may have over public decision-making, the first chief is expected routinely to take the initiative in many small decisions and administrative actions, such as dictating letters to be sent to other islands, deciding which variety of gathering to hold on a given evening, and, if it is to be a sacred meeting, which chief will sing. These actions are allowed to stand unless the men feel moved to overturn them (see Howe 1978b:548-549, for an example)."																															834	No	"Within this area of administrative competence, the chief exercises the widest discretion away from his village. One of the major modalities of his role is ambassador or emissary; voyaging on behalf of his followers seems to have constituted a major portion of chiefly duties at least as early as the nineteenth century (see Holloman 1969:273-274, 418). As noted above, village members expect their chief to represent their wishes while away from home, and they reserve the right to reverse any commitments he has made. Moreover, they very often send others with him on his travels, including at least a secretary-interpreter and usually another leader or two as well. Nevertheless, when a village sends its chief to expedite an application, to appeal a dispute with another village to a higher authority, to hold caucus with allied islands over a current issue, or to represent them in an interisland meeting, it must allow him scope to negotiate and maneuver, and in this context chiefs do exercise considerable influence. Any successes they enjoy while away, moreover, strengthen their hand at home. (For examples of such negotiations and initiatives, see later chapters and cases, also Howe 1974:189-190.)"																															835	No	"Some of the entitlements (Burke 1966; Crocker 1977) for Kuna chiefs link chieftainship with policymaking, as well as with comprehensive and long-range perspectives. A chief is an itueti “leader,” from the verb itue “to lead,” which in turn derives from the adjective itu “before.” Other men may also be called leaders ( itumalatti), but he is the one to whom the root word before applies most strongly, the one who “must anticipate, find the way ahead of time” ( itu-itu ikal amierkepe). Ordinary people, it is said, handle problems “just superficially” ( ukkaskimpi) in terms of the immediate issues at hand, but chiefs should deal with them “in depth” ( akkapaysale), by bringing in precedents from the immediate past, pointing out parallels from Father’s Way, and by anticipating future problems and developments. The Kuna call such a chief a ney seet, “carrier of the place,” a title suggesting that he keeps his village moving as well as bearing its burden (see Howe 1977)."																															836	No	"To one extent or another, the ideal of the carrier of the place informs the conduct of a good many chiefs. The leader I knew best, who was first chief of Pirya and later of Urwanapirya, felt a special responsibility to provide for orphans and other dependent people and a duty to see that almost everyone obtained at least a little land, on the theory that dispossessed people offered a threat to community stability. He tried to gauge long-trends in San Blas and Panama and to tailor his policy recommendations to them, and when the moment seemed ripe, he proposed regulations, policies, and other initiatives in the gathering (see Howe 1974:193-194). The chief of Mokirkanti, even in the much shorter period in which I observed him, also tried to take the long view. In one speech, [Page 98] for instance, he pointed out the disappearance of traditional curers in the village, arguing that, however much most people might prefer traditional medicine, they had no alternative to expanding the village health clinic."																															838	No	"From my experience, Kuna chiefs seldom enjoy support or a personal following of the sort Bailey seems to have in mind. In a Kuna village, support consists more of a decision about a leader, and less of personal allegiance to him. Each member is continually assessing the performance of village leaders in terms of all criteria that inspire positive and negative judgments—effectiveness as leader, willingness to do the work of attending regional congresses, ability to speak Spanish, knowledge of Father’s Way, temperament, generosity, and so forth. The composite of all those evaluations results in an overall opinion of each leader and a judgment as to whether he should continue in office. The aggregate of all the members’ judgments, in turn, largely determines what happens to each leader. Thus, it seems to me, we can understand support for Kuna leaders in terms of a quasi-electoral model, in which candidates court the favor of the electorate, and in which each voter decides between candidates in terms of a personal calculus, better than we can in terms of a model of personal followership."																															839	No	"First, Kuna chiefs lead enduring corporate units. The unit may keep its chief as its symbol and representative, but its existence does not depend on him. As Landé’s incisive analysis of transactional groupings shows (1977:xxix), the relations between corporate groups and their leaders differ from patron-client relationships in a number of ways. Among other things, the members of a corporate group are members even in the absence of dyadic ties with its leader, the group can have goals other than the leader’s own, and they can act as a unit vis-à-vis the leader as well as vis-à-vis other groups. Thus it is highly unlikely that a Kuna chief would hold all or most of his village members as a personal following, in the way that a Nambikuara band leader (Lévi-Strauss 1944), a Pathan khan (Barth 1959), or a Melanesian Big Man (Sahlins 1963) are described as doing."																															840	No	"Of course, it is possible that a Kuna chief might maintain a personal following within his village, as an example of what Landé calls “addenda” to institutionalized relationships (1977:xxi). As Landé also points out, however, clients or followers must by definition be rewarded differentially: the chief must be able to offer protection, spoils, prestige, influence, or something else desirable to his followers that he does not offer to other [Page 105] members of the wider corporate unit. Here a Kuna chief is at a disadvantage. He seldom has the personal resources to reward his followers, and the village systematically denies him its collective resources. He cannot enrich his followers, nor can he offer them special protection. The most he can do is show favoritism in those areas where public actions affect people individually, namely, in adjudication, and in the demands and benefits of communal labor. The dispersal of influence among multiple leaders makes showing favoritism difficult, however, and the tendency toward nope “being jealous” discussed in chapter 3 makes it costly. Kuna are quick to respond angrily if they feel they have been slighted or another has been unduly favored. Favoritism was notable for its absence on both my primary field sites. It seems to crop up occasionally on other islands, but its political costs are high. Favoritism in communal labor makes those not favored less willing to work, and a biased judgment in an adjudication makes people less willing to accept future judgments (see the discussion in chapter 10)."																															841	No	"Several themes characteristic of chieftainship return in this chapter. The distrust of leaders and the tensions between individual leadership and collective control appear again in a readiness to believe that secretaries may be up to no good, in a tendency to throw out task leaders when problems arise, and in the practice of appointing several men to each office to monitor each other’s actions. The ambivalence between exalting and debasing chiefs seems to turn up in the ambiguities of ranking and an unwillingness to create a linear chain of command. Here, as with chiefs, the Kuna display a great deal of ambivalence about leadership, hierarchy, and collective action—about, in other words, just those qualities their political system seems so notably to embody."																															842	No	"Women have so far played no formal role in village government, except for a very few elected in recent years as junior arkar or sakla. Almost all villages hold at least occasional singing gatherings exclusively for women, and a few have women’s talking meetings, although males usually preside and women are given little scope for decision making or debate. In the last few years, however, a women’s mola cooperative, initiated in the 1960s by the Peace Corps and now with chapters on a number of islands, has begun not only to offer leadership roles for women but also to provide a forum in which to discuss issues of interest to them, including but not limited to co-op business (Brennan Hatley 1976; Tice n.d. 1, n.d. 2; Sherzer 1983: 70-71)."																															843	No	"My analysis of village hierarchies begins straightforwardly with the question of rank. The Kuna, although in many respects strongly egalitarian, also pay considerable attention to rank and precedence. They talk about who is bigger ( pur tumma) and who smaller ( pur pippikwa); who is the foremost in a leader category ( e ituet, e tummat) and who is next ( yarpalit) or secondary ( sorpalit); who is a notable or leader ( tummat “big one”) and who a follower ( sorta). Within each officer set, every man is unambiguously ranked, one, two, three, four, and the same linear hierarchy at first seems to hold for all the officers taken together. Rank order certainly seems clear for the traditional core offices, chief, arkar, and policeman, as is the seniority of chief and arkar over all others."																															844	No	"The village hierarchy is flexible, depending on the needs of the village--particularly its size. One man may hold several offices. The Saila is the chief of the village, its representative to the outside world. He presides at meetings, and has as a main chore the preaching of homilies, and recalling the proper way of Cuna life by means of folk tales, tribal histories, and so forth. He is generally a learned man, and as the office takes much time, must generally have several sons-in-law to carry on the work of his house-hold. He is thus generally an older man. As a result of the play of acculturative forces, subsequent to the revolution, some men of lesser ability have been elected chief. There are one or more assistant chiefs who preside in the absence of the main chief. Other than at ceremonies the chief is not entitled to any particular respect forms. Many chiefs maintain one or more secretaries who are literate in Spanish or English."																															845	No	"The High Chief is chosen from among the village chiefs, still retaining his village chieftanship, and is elected for life. The ‘capital’ of the party is the chief’s own village. Other than his secretaries and interpreters there are no other party officials. Meetings are irregularly held when there are problems to be discussed. De Smidt mentions that representation is on the basis of about one delegate for each one hundred inhabitants of a village. This is not a fixed number, and a village may send as many delegates to a meeting as it wishes. The chief does not have extensive power, other than what his personality allows; though his prestige is highly respected. He affirms elections of village chiefs, and inspects villages for cleanliness. These inspections are seriously taken by the Cuna, and there is much cleaning and polishing when the visit of the chief is announced.”"																															846	No	"The main pre-requisite to being elected party chief is a vast knowledge of esoteric lore, primarily with regard to tribal history. Though there is no connection with shamanism, it is not surprising that many of the chiefs, from at least the seventeenth century to the present, have been Neles. Actually it is usually only Neles who have the necessary reputation beyond the confines of their own village. The office is by no means hereditary, though kinship is an aid if the new candidate possesses the other qualifications. Though there are many headaches and no material rewards in connection with party office, the prestige makes it sought after. At the meetings the delegates are carefully seated with an eye to relative status. The leaders are generally masterful politicians, who are ever watchful to keep brilliant aspirants in their proper place. (see Wassén, 1938, p. 50; Nordenskiöld, 1938, for political speeches by Chief Colman). At inter-village meetings the High Chief renders the first ‘sing’, followed by other chiefs in order of status. The factors which go into the exact attainment of this status are unknown to the author.”"																															847	No	"“Each household has a directing head, usually the eldest man. Each village has a saila, or chief, and a second head; if large, a third. The saila is the selection of the majority and generally serves for the balance of his life. The village may depose him for another, but this is rare and always for good cause. His leadership is advisory rather than dominant. Actions or changes that effect the village as a whole are decided by the voice of the people."																															848	No	"A considerable number of Kuna know English, again with varying degrees of proficiency. There are a few older men who in their youth were sailors on North American ships and still remember some of the words and phrases they heard and used, in English or even sometimes in other languages, such as French. They usually know the colorful, popular, and obscene language of sailors—as a result, they are most humorous interlocutors. Younger men who work or have worked in the Canal Zone also pick up some English. English is valued and appreciated perhaps even more than Spanish. People like to hear it spoken, even if they do not understand it, and those who know a little will often try it out on a visiting native speaker of English. This gives them pleasure and pride and provides amusement for themselves as well as others. For ritual and traditional leaders, especially political leaders such as ‘chiefs,’ knowledge of English, like that of Spanish, is quite positively valued by others. It is one more bit of linguistic ability at their disposal, linguistic ability being one of the primary criteria for selection as a ‘chief.’"																															850	No	"In addition to the roles in Kuna society associated with the political and ritual traditions, there are those involved in day-to-day activities. There are the leaders of such activities as house building, boat [Page 65] repairing, planting, and harvesting. The groups involved in these activities range in size from a few associates who have formed a cooperative to an entire village. Although such people are chosen in part for their ability to perform the tasks in question—house building, canoe building, and so forth—they are selected primarily for their leadership ability, which signifies the ability to lead with language and speech, to speak loudly, fluently, often, creatively, and effectively. It is significant that these task leaders are called ‘chiefs,’ for example, nek sopet sakla (house-building chief) or okop sakla (coconut chief). Similarly, in any organization that arises among the Kuna, and many do—cooperative enterprises and associations for a great range of purposes—leaders are chosen for their ability to talk effectively."																															852	No	"Almost the only trace of pre-Conquest feeling is to be found in the great reverence shown towards all shamans and Government appointees. An ordinary Indian will offer food, drink, or tobacco to all men of authority present before taking anything himself, even though it means the consumption, for instance, of almost all of a bottle of aguardiente before he gets any at all. We saw a chief at Tenango, where the same system prevails, take a lighted cigar from an Indian's mouth, giving him instead some unrolled tobacco leaves. When first coming into the presence of such men, or passing them on the road, an Indian will take off his hat, bowing deeply; the chief or shaman touches the Indian's forehead, and he goes on. This is performed with grace and dignity. It is known as k`ol-tanup , “head giving” ( k`ol from hol , head). Instances were observed of thus [Page 358] “giving the head” to certain elder women, but the reason could not be ascertained."																															853	No	"The chieftaincy of each clan was filled by the oldest man, who was called chunel . (It seems to have the same meaning as the word catinab , but some informants recognized the latter as the one used in the adjacent municipality of Oxchuc.) The office was not hereditary, and upon the death of a chunel the oldest man of the clan was venerated as such. The chief of the clan was respected and feared, because he was recognized as endowed with supernatural power which, through his lab , he exercised over all the members of the clan. Two informants of advanced age defined the chunel as “the oldest one and the greatest sorcerer.” The lab feeds on souls, and a person who has “done wrong” is “eaten” by the lab of the one offended and dies. In this way social control was exercised on and among the members of the clan, never going beyond the limits of this."																															854	No	"Each culibal has its own chiefs, elected from and by those members who have filled political-religious positions in the Chakel or Ayuntamiento /municipal government/. The clans are taken into account in this election, rigorously taking turns. The culibal chiefs assign the communal lands, organize the collective tasks for the benefit of the community, pray for the health and [Page 9] /7 cont./ the harvests of all on the appointed days, and collect the taxes on the lands of the culibal , which they take to the seat of the municipality of Ocosingo, from which Cancuc depends in the capacity of municipal agency. An order given by a chief is obeyed without discussion by all the members of the corresponding culibal . The men of each culibal participate in the local government in equal number and category, just as also in the filling of religious positions, the clans always taking turns."																															855	No	"In the man's life cycle, leadership roles are related to age. Paternal roles are the prototype for both familial and public authority positions. Thus the term for father, tat is the stem for the term for leader, statal ."																															856	No	"The economic roles created with the introduction of new enterprises have not been integrated in the traditional pattern of recruitment and control. In the association of cattle breeders, leadership tends to be based on the size of the herd; in the case of the truck cooperative, amount of capital invested and entrepreneurial skills have determined the leadership of the enterprise, while driving skill and ability to get along in the Ladino world has been the basis for choice of drivers. Such achievement principles as the basis for recruitment into these envied positions are not accepted in the same way that age and passage through a hierarchy of posts validated higher positions in the old hierarchies. The conspicuous expenditure of wealth in the more expensive posts in the religious hierarchy has also failed to lessen hostility aroused by the increasing disparity in wealth, and in fact those who have served as alférez have been even more subject to witchcraft aroused by envy."																															857	No	"The office of gobernador is the most important of all. The gobernador is unquestionably the leader, while the other officials serve in an advisory capacity. He is the spokesman of the people. His words of advice must be sound and fearlessly spoken. Indeed, his oratorical ability may cover up serious deficiencies, since the Indians admire “strong” sermons. The gobernador represents his pueblo when contacts are to be made with outsiders, when interpueblo races are to be arranged, when a complaint is to be made to the Mexican governmental authorities, and in other transactions of this kind."																															858	No	"While wealth would facilitate matters, it is not considered essential. The contacts the gobernador makes with outsiders and the intermittent consultations with the Mexican governmental authorities would seem to indicate that a speaking knowledge of Spanish was desirable, but only one of the last seven leaders of Samachique has been able to speak Spanish. The qualities sought in a man are general community respect, good fellowship, and a quiet serious-mindedness, even while drinking."																															859	No	"The government of the pueblos meets the Tarahumara requirements quite satisfactorily. It is the exceptional case (usually a Mexican dispute) which has to be taken to the Mexican authorities for settlement. The chief function of the gobernadors is the administration of law, and their manner of conducting legal procedure is the subject matter of the next chapter."																															860	No	"Among the modern Tarahumaras, the gobernador has three major duties. These are: (1) preaching homiletic “sermons” at the regular meetings of the people with their officials; (2) representing the pueblo in transactions with outsiders; (3) acting as chief judge at legal trials and as arbitrator of disputes among his people. There seems to be little doubt that these three functions are all ancient traits. Representing one’s people, either personally or through delegates, seems to be a duty of chiefs the world over and throughout all time. There is no evidence that Tarahumara chiefs have ever differed in this respect. As to the chief’s role as arbitrator, this is so common and universal a practice among the Tarahumaras today that it is [Page 378] unlikely that it is a recently acquired or developed trait. It is true that occasionally modern Tarahumaras bring their disputes to Mexican officials but this is not a common pattern. It is likewise probable that in colonial times there were some few Indians who, for one reason or another, brought their problems to the missionary or to Spanish authorities rather than to their own chiefs."																															861	No	"The gobernador is the most highly respected and important figure in the Tarahumara pueblo. There are certain qualifications that this official must meet. While his lands, house or dress may not appear to mark him as a man apart from others, his manner, self-assured bearing and posture, and above all, his effective forceful speech, does distinguish him from others. Such attributes are sought for in choosing this official because the quality of his leadership depends upon his persuasiveness, the force of his [Page -31-] personality and reasonableness in handling disputes. It is these qualities that lend weight to his suggestions, advice and decrees, though it must be added that behind the words of the gobernador is the threat of the “big stick,” the threat of public censure or whipping."																															862	No	"There are certain activities which require the cooperation and coordination of many individuals. For example, there are elaborate church fiestas in which there are many active performers such as, dancers and dance leaders, musicians, those who prepare food and drink, those who decorate the altars in the church, etc. Besides these church fiestas, there are work tesguinadas which involve as many as score of workers. There can be no doubt, then, that a high degree of organization of persons is possible in Tarahumara society. But, it must be stated that the above [Page -77-] occasions are very special ones, and that the Tarahumara live in rather isolated, largely independent household units which do not interact and cooperate with one another on a daily basis."																															863	No	"Individuals in Tarahumara society attain positions of respect and leadership by demonstrating in their interpersonal relationships a skill in handling other people. This skill takes the form of calm and reasonable persuasion rather than an appeal to force. The society is essentially composed of social equals. There is a remarkable homogeneity in house type, dress, and diet. Cooperation in organized activities follows from an individualistic and egalitarian orientation and is largely based upon voluntary associations. A high degree of organized social activity is possible under such conditions for limited occasions. The two organized activities described, the church fiesta and the work tesguinada, are evidence of this condition."																															864	No	"In spite of all this, a surplus of corn is important for wealth because it allows an individual to make tesgüino more often for cooperative work, and so larger areas may be kept under cultivation. One who does this is regarded as living up to his obligations and benefitting the whole community. Everyone enjoys tesgüinadas and considers them one of the important activities. Just as significant, the tesgüinada host remains a giver rather than a taker and thus merits prestige and leadership. He is one to whom others must come for help ( kórima ). Beer and beer parties are basic to the social life of the community, and the ability to make tesgüino in the season when some are wondering where their next meal is coming from is a critical indicator of wealth and power. They are highly valued as one of the few means of communal gathering, recreation, and social intercourse. Further, the man with a surplus of corn can afford to have hired help, to maintain more destitute relatives, and to have his son or daughter stay with him in a joint household, or at least nearby, after marriage."																															865	No	"While there are correlations between influence, prestige, and official position in the Inápuchi area, the connections among these factors are weak, and this seems related to the lack of functions and power inherent in official statuses. A man needs a fairly high social ranking to attain the position of siríame, but he who attains that status is not necessarily the man of highest ranking. On the other hand, high social ranking is necessary for leadership, yet social leadership is not always or inevitably associated with official position. To clarify this let us examine the relationships of the important elements: social ranking, prestige, influence, official status, and leadership.It should already be clear that there are no social or economic strata among the Tarahumara, yet important differences in ranking exist. Neither social ranking nor leadership is inherited [Page 186] by birth. Both are dependent upon personal qualities and wealth, and these two criteria go together; that is, positions of prestige and influence tend to be achieved rather than ascribed."																															866	No	"People moving up the prestige ladder may pass through several stages after adulthood and marriage. The man destined to become a successful leader will usually cultivate every available bit of ground, even if it means making long journeys to his wife’s parents’ rancho . He will accumulate a large herd of goats and several cattle through judicious trading and careful tending, and he will begin early to hold tesgüinadas of his own. When he is given a minor position such as sontársi, chokéame, or later warúala, he will execute his role with initiative. He may also begin to feel that he has some owerúame powers. If this occurs he will then begin to dream about people’s sicknesses and perhaps assist an older curer in larger curing fiestas. Skills as a [Page 187] supernatural specialist are not necessary to leadership, but they benefit the ambitious. As we have seen, curing abilities in themselves provide a separate avenue of social mobility."																															867	No	"When a man is inclined to leadership he may find himself requested to give sermons or lectures when the tesgüino is flowing. If he becomes a person of substance and is aggressive in the ways described he will rise, for these are the qualities of the influential man. A reputation for such personal attributes is built up over the years concomitantly with wealth, which is taken as one sign of having them."																															868	No	"Young Tarahumara men are seldom leaders, but age in itself is not the critical criterion; in neither the gentile or bautizado areas are extremely old men found in any position of authority. It takes considerable time to develop substance and build a reputation, but after a certain point men feel that they have done their duty, and the physical vigor thought to be requisite for leadership becomes attenuated. The leader must be able to drink, speak, and work forcefully."																															869	No	"Each tira in the above list is led by a hereditary Raiz (leader), and has traditional rights to specific pastures and camping sites. These grazing rights are usually exclusive, or they may be shared with local villagers, who raise a crop in the spring and let the Jaf flocks graze there in the fall. Formerly, this relation between nomad and sedentary might be established by force by the Jaf on any land; now some rent is generally paid to the local farmers in return for right to pasturage. The migrations of the whole Jaf ashiret are coordinated, and the movement of each tira is regulated by its Raiz , who serves as intermediary between his group and the Begzada leaders of the whole ashiret ."																															870	No	"The hereditary position as Raiz is simply vested in the leading lineage segment of the tira . An interesting problem arises as to what adjustments are made in the event of decline in wealth or the appearance of other impediments to leadership in this lineage. It is costumary for persons in a position of leadership to appoint their successor, usually a son, while they are still in a position of control. In the case of disagreement between the existing Raiz and the general population as to who should succeed him, the pattern of succession is probably decided by the bias in the balance between the positive power (primarily economic) of the Raiz , and the degree of general resentment to his decision. Where the power and prestige of the Raiz has declined, leadership might thus fairly easily be shifted to a stronger and wealthier collateral line. (Compare p. 126 for a more nearly[unknown] democratic[unknown] mechanism of appointing successor to the Raiz .)"																															871	No	"The Agha of a village is appointed or granted power by the male inhabitants of that village. In practice, the position is hereditary, but not according to any rule of seniority, and village preference undoubtedly influences the pattern of succession. The village Agha has only the authority which follows from his own power and prestige, and the goodwill of his followers."																															872	No	"When left to their own devices, the villagers generally elect to office the older male leader of the largest kinship group. As a consequence of the marriage pattern, such kinship groups tend to separate off as endogamous blocks. But due to the lower frequency of FaBrDa marriage among the non-tribal villagers (see p. 68), these blocks show less organization and unity than the endogamous subsections in the tribal system, and could not properly be called lineages. Furthermore, they tend to be bilateral, in the sense that relationships traced through female links attain some importance. The relative sizes of these bilateral kinship blocks change fairly slowly, so village headmanship, as well as leadership in the kinship groups, tends to follow an apparently hereditary pattern from father to son."																															873	No	"The powers of the kikha derive in part from his powers as the head of such a group, in part from his closer relations with the landowner, and the implicit threat of reporting illegalities (or in fact making false accusations) to him. As the leader of the village, [Page 49] he also exercises certain rights in his relations with the landowner -- he can e. g. exclude any newcomer from village membership."																															874	No	"The final and most spectacular occasion for the emergence of leadership and the expression of a status hierarchy is offered by the [Page 115] situation of armed conflict. The conceptual separation of peace chief and war chief, frequently found in other societies, is lacking in the Kurdish area; thus the leader in war is also the leader in peace, and differences in total status organize the men of a local community in a single, universally relevant hierarchy of individuals. The pertinent questions in the present connection regarding armed conflict are then concerned with who initiates it, and what the extent and nature of his following is."																															875	No	"A feast in one form or another is thus a fairly frequent occurrance in the village. Since it will involve at least a major part and usually the whole of the village, it provides one of the major occasions in which leadership and moderate rivalry is expressed, and in which the relative prestige and resultant total status positions become systematized. Essentially, these feasts are of two major types, (1) connected with religious festivals, or (2) marking transitions of status in the life cycle of members of the society."																															876	No	"The Aghas of villages could also independently initiate war parties -- a development carried to the extreme in the case of the Hamawands. Such war or raiding parties also served as steppingstones for political advancement -- the Hamawand who conquered a village would sooner or later break loose from the Agha that backed him, and constitute himself as an Agha on his own right. In the non-tribal areas, this was more easily done, and the successful warleader might carve out a small domain for himself. In the tribal system, the raiding parties directed towards the conquest of land were generally composed of near kin, who were, in fact, relieving local village population pressure and looking for a new place to settle down. The feudal lord, on the other hand, recruited his soldiers where he could, though there was a conscious attempt, as pointed out in the discussion of Baban organization to utilize tribal solidarity and use smaller groups of tribesmen to control larger groups of non-tribal peasants. Thus, [Page 116] leadership in war parties, and resultant conquest, was a major path of status mobility."																															877	No	"The impediment of female sex . The clearest case, illustrating the type of problem I am concerned with, relates to the position of the woman who, except for her sex, fulfills all the requirements of a leader. I have previously stated that the woman plays no active part in political life in the widest sense. On the village level, that seems to be invariably true. But on the supra-village level, there are some exceptions. The problem, in the Kurdish system, amounts to what should take precedence, the impediment of female sex, or the qualifications of high family status, wealth, etc. In the village, the differences in family status and wealth are not great enough to counter-balance an obverse difference in sex; among the leading families of Southern Kurdistan, these differences in status and wealth as compared to the general population become great enough to override the impediment of female sex, and in several cases women have emerged as leaders of considerable consequence."																															878	No	"To become a good politician it has been necessary to leave mother-mountain and descend to the cities of the plains, where politicking is a well-developed craft. When, and if, an expatriate returns to the mountains, he will no longer be trusted wholeheartedly by the common people; it is as if he has lost his virtue by leaving the apron of mother-mountain and living among the crafty plains people. These men always seem eager to tell the Kurds how quickly they can succeed once they become non-Kurdish in every way (see Integration & Assimilation ). Indeed, Kurds living in the plains cities are seldom considered to be Kurds by those living in the highlands, and are not trusted to be leaders. To know the secrets of the mountains, the passes, rivers, and caves; to know the tribal customs; and to be brave, are essential characteristics of Kurdish chiefs and leaders."																															879	No	"Faced with the erosion of their power base through the settlement of the nomads and [Page 205] the much faster numerical growth of the settled peasants, many important tribal leaders came to realize the importance of religious status. Through actual training in the religious laws or otherwise via Sufi mystic leadership, many tribal leaders were able to tap into the source of the wider popularity of the religious leaders The chiefs of the Bârzâni, particularly Shaykh Ahmad, are good examples of this phenomenon."																															880	No	"Tribal leaders are by no means reactionary or uneducated country folks. College education, often at Western universities, is almost universal among the family members of the chiefs. As the older generation passes, the new Kurdish tribal chiefs boast as much education and worldliness as any national-level politician in a recognized state."																															881	No	"Since these modern political leaders behave (and are perceived by their followers) as neo-tribal leaders, their image, particularly in Iraqi Kurdistan, has been that of the concerned father rather than of the political leader that can be voted in or out of office by virtue of their portfolio of performance. As long as they are doing what they can, they have the loyalty of their people; that is, of course, as long as they maintain the fundamental virtues associated with such leaders: courage, loyalty, dignity, and magnanimity. Neither wisdom nor diplomacy are fundamental requirements (see National Character ). As such, their mistakes seldom weaken their position as leaders. They may be perceived as bad leaders, but they are leaders nevertheless, and continue to receive support, even reverence."																															882	No	"In the case of the Balik, as we have seen, the Agha of the largest taifa, Mullasherifi, is also Agha paramount of the whole tribe, and this is doubtless the normal rule. His function as tribal Agha does not ever seem to have amounted to very much except in time of war, in which case he automatically became leader of the whole group and doubtless received economic benefits accordingly. In time of peace he only receives small token payments, such as gifts of fruit and the like, from his more remote subordinates."																															883	No	"The foregoing analysis has thrown emphasis on the fact that the Agha is of the same kinship group as the majority of his followers and very closely related to many of them. It was interesting to note that in conversation Mir Hamid Amin of Dergala differentiated between “Khezm khoimana” (my relatives) and “kurmanj” (peasantry), but I doubt whether there is any precise dividing line between the two classifications."																															884	No	"The chieftain, to a large extent, is the symbol of his people's honor, tribesmen or tenants, and this is a matter of supreme importance to both Arab and Kurd. Honor has a large number of aspects of which the most important are the obligation of vengeance, safeguard and sanctuary, the integrity of women, and hospitality. If a man has been murdered, it is incumbent on his relatives to avenge his death, and this is the beginning of the vendetta or blood-feud. The peaceful solution is the payment of badalkhwin or blood-money, an amount calculated in goods or cash, but [Page 181] usually there is speedy recourse to arms and a vendetta can extend over decades and count scores of victims. In the case of commoners, the chieftains of the people involved often intervene, and sometimes pay the badalkhwin from their own purses, but, failing this, they are expected to aid in obtaining revenge. In the case of aristocratic households, the matter is not settled so easily, although, in rare situations, a third neutral party, a great chieftain known for his piety and justice, may be asked to arbitrate. The most famous feud of the district was that between the Houses of Isma'il Beg and Nuri Bawil Agha, beginning in the days of the first World War, temporarily at an end with the murder of the former and the life imprisonment of the latter. There were many casualties on both sides, and several of the participants are still in prison, such as Isma'il Beg's bailiff, and the two uncles of his mother, Lali Khan, Mustafa Agha and Zirar Agha. Although Rowanduz is non-tribal and is not bound to this or that chieftain, the townsmen took sides in the quarrel, mostly on that of Isma'il Beg, and the quarrel lingers on. The party of Nuri Bawil Agha has now practically disappeared, and his son, Karim Agha, who resides in the town, does not dare approach the vicinity of Isma'il Beg's house from fear of further reprisal."																															885	No	"The vendetta has been one of the foremost features of Kurdish life for centuries, and, in spite of its toll in lives, has something of the aspect of a game or sport. Unless commoners or whole tribes are involved, most of [Page 182] the casualties are sustained by the chieftains and their bodyguards, a sort of exchange of assassinations, and there is nothing which might be termed “total warfare.” If a chieftain is engaged in a feud with another, he does not ordinarily try to kill off the other's peasantry or destroy their crops, but rather attempts the ambush of his adversary or that person's immediate relatives and followers. There are several examples to indicate that feuding parties do not like the idea of decisive contests. The causes of such conflicts are extremely varied, although women are said to be one of the most frequent, and are often trivial. The government, insisting on its own justice, has a great deal of trouble with these affairs, and, at the same time, has used them to its own advantage. One of the chief reasons for the failure of Kurdish revolts over the years has been the fact that the leaders are just as interested in the overthrow of each other as in that of the government."																															886	No	"This atmosphere of violence is an everyday feature of life in Rowanduz, but it must be stressed that actual danger does not in any way extend to the common people nor, under normal circumstances, the [Page 184] government personnel. It would be easy for an outsider to romanticize this situation, and this could not be far from wrong, for the Kurds do the same themselves. The chieftain is the surmation of a peasant's ideals, a formidable warrior, unremitting in vengeance, generous in hospitality, and gallant in conduct."																															887	No	"Sanctuary is something of major importance among the Kurds. If a man had committed a crime, usually a murder, he could throw himself on the mercy of the nearest chieftain and the latter was bound by honor to protect him from his pursuers. Often the chieftain paid the badalkhwin or blood-money to the injured parties, although unrelated to them or to the criminal, as a generous gesture. Of greater interest, perhaps, the chieftain provided sanctuary for runaway lovers. If a youth and a maiden fell in love and their parents forbade the match, they sometimes fled together, and, if captured by their irate relatives, would be slain. It is said that the first thing for such fugitives to do is to have intercourse, so they cannot be separated except by death, for a woman who has lost her virginity out of wedlock must be killed by her kinsmen. If the pair were able to reach a chieftain, the latter now acted as a matchmaker. He sought out the parents of the girl, informed them that their daughter was under his protection, attempted to reconcile them to the marriage, by this time consummated, end often paid the dowry of the bride, again, as a matter [Page 186] of generosity. Commoners are not in a position to quarrel with a chieftain, and the problem was usually solved in this way. The youth was summoned and kissed the hand of his reluctant father-in-law, addressing him as a parent. If, however, the fugitive couple belonged to aristocratic houses, the most sanguine of vendettas could follow."																															889	No	"In addition, such decision-making roles and positions assume a degree of leadership which is inconsistent with the egalitarian values of Inuit society. Leadership and authority ultimately generate a certain degree of conflict, with the result that the Inuit office holder will disavow his influence and attend to his duties in a tactful manner (Honigmann and Honigmann 1965:232; Valee 1962:198). As the Honigmanns (1965:241) aptly observe: “leadership apologizes for its existence.” Perhaps for this reason, whites who occupy such positions are more readily accepted since their function does not undermine any pre-existing Inuit status."																															890	No	"One of the most noticeable features in Eskimo society almost everywhere is the absence of chiefs, and the Copper Eskimos are no exception. A man acquires influence by his force of character, his energy and success in hunting, or his skill in magic. As long as these last him age but increases his influence, but when they fail his prestige and authority vanish. Although there were at least half a dozen shamans in Dolphin and Union strait, and Ikpakhuak himself professed no shamanistic powers, yet his personal dignity, his sagacity, and his prowess as a hunter won him the most prominent place among the natives of this region. He had no delegated powers, no established authority, but his counsels always carried the greatest weight and his advice was constantly sought in all matters of importance."																															891	No	"However, prior to 1800, both furs and game were plentiful and Indians could obtain enough pelts to supply their trade needs with ease. They, hence, devoted much time to travel between competing stores to obtain extra credit. Only when climatic factors were unfavorable did they suffer from starvation. Clan-named hunting groups numbering about 25 to 30 individuals or more exploited group-owned areas. These large cohesive groups continued to be led by chiefs who inherited their position patrilineally and through primogeniture. "																															892	No	"Of the native foods, the moose is the most important and most sought after. Usually about 100 are killed annually. Most of these are killed in the fall or late winter by men on their trapping territories. A few moose are also taken by men at the summer fish camps on Lake St. Joseph. High-powered rifles and 22's are the chief weapons used, although two hunters have employed large [Page 25] snares made of telephone wire within the last few years. A great deal of prestige is accorded a good moose hunter, and to be considered such is a mark of manliness and leadership. "																															893	No	"Concomitant with these changes has been the decline in authority of the hunting group leader. Where in the past the efficacy of leadership was grounded in magico-religious power attained through the vision quest; missionary influence, improved medical treatment, and education have undermined this basis. Leaders could control the animals necessary for survival and trade, and apply sanctions through the fear of magical power upon wrongdoers. Today, the money economy and subsidies have lessened the importance of subsistence techniques with regard to survival, and the retributive sanctions are no longer feared. In a compact acephalous community composed of formerly dispersed hunting groups, many of whose functions have been taken over by outside sources, social control within such a community is largely restricted to gossip groups (cf. Dunning 1959a:184), and the household tends to emerge as a self-sufficient unit (cf. Rogers 1962:B81). Despite these recent changes, however, there is still the need for economic assistance beyond the household related to bush life at the fish camps and the spring trapping camps."																															894	No	"Leadership was vested in the heads of the co-residential groups who held their position through their hunting abilities and supernatural power as shamans. Shamans had the ability to foresee future events and the ability within certain limits to control them. These men were feared as well as respected and prior to 1900, most leaders were polygynists. Leadership in 1900, was based upon individual initiative and the vision quest and was not inherited, a fact that is congruent with the bilateral structure of Ojibwa society at this date (cf. Helm 1965).Leaders in the [Page 100] past had supernatural powers and their position was based partly on fear (cf. Dunning 1959a:182), while at present the criteria for leadership are changing, and the few remaining shamans have practically no power. These changes can be directly correlated with external White influences, especially the marked increase in government subsidies and control within the past two decades."																															895	No	"Indeed, the art of playing off one trader against another became so well developed that it may be posited that considerable prestige was accorded individuals who excelled in it. A band leader who was able to procure more goods would also be likely to have a larger following."																															896	No	"We can now introduce the word “responsibility.” It might be said that each individual has a responsibility to take charge of his own life and needs insofar as possible. The creatures with the greatest autonomy and self-sufficiency rank high. It is recognized, however, that no man survives alone, that social tasks must get done, and that someone must be in charge. An Ojibwa root, debenima-, has been variously translated as ‘boss’, ‘master’, ‘the one in charge’, or the one in ‘control’. But the favored translation of a sensitive bilingual was ‘those I am responsible for’. The idea of bossing is generally rejected, as is the idea of competition, yet both must occur at times. It can be seen that the areas of social control, of leadership and political structure, of the various cooperating social units necessary to kinship organization and to subsistence activities—all these must be balanced somehow to accord with the rules of the system about power (see note 6)."																															897	No	"IT HAS generally been assumed, at least by most 20th-century scholars, popular novelists, and movie makers, that beyond the household level band and village affairs were invariably in the hands of male leaders or chiefs. This point of view ignores the fact that leadership had a wide variety of contexts in the yearly round of Ojibway life. Groups to be governed could be as small as a single family or berry-picking party or as large as intertribal war parties or the people who came together for village ceremonials. In general, men led male-oriented pursuits such as the hunt or a war party, while women leaders supervised activities within the female domain. There were occasions, however, when elderly women were chosen as spokespersons for hunting bands. These women managed the products of the hunt and negotiated deals with the traders. 2"																															898	No	"The duties of a chief included the presiding at councils of his band, the making of decisions that affected their general welfare, and the settlement of small disputes. He represented the band at the signing of treaties, the payment of annuities, and any large gathering of the tribe."																															899	No	"It was said that “the leader of a war party gets all the credit if it is successful.” This is in accordance with the Indian precept that a man must earn whatever honor is bestowed upon him. The man who secured scalps of the enemy was honored, but the man who simply went with the war party and did not distinguish himself in any way does not seem to have been lauded for that action."																															900	No	"Each chief personally received a little more than the Indians, this being called the “surplus.” As a matter of fact, the quantity of goods required for the chiefs was taken out first, each receiving according to the size of his band, and the remainder was divided pro rata among the Indians."																															901	No	"As formerly the specialists were polygynists, Levi-Strauss's discussion of the position of chiefs among the Nambikuara (1944, pp. [Page 182] 16–32) is relevant here. A chief was essential for the continuity of a collecting band. But how was a man persuaded to assume the extremely onerous task of chiefship when the society lacked almost any form of economic surplus or ritual prestige as reward to the office-holder? Levi-Strauss suggests that polygyny was the means of reward in an economy otherwise at the basic level of subsistence."																															902	No	"Levi-Strauss's analysis of polygyny among the Nambikuara suggests that its function was to secure a candidate for the office of chief, whereas in Pekangekum polygyny was the result of individual initiative on the part of the polygynist himself. The function in both, however, is similar. In the latter it is a reflection of his increased status, in part sanctioned by his success in medicine and conjuring, and in part self-assumed, demonstrating as it did his higher status. This increased and sometimes growing status was sanctioned by the belief in his curing techniques as well as fear of possible sorcery. It seems logical then that in this society which contained such a minimum of differential [Page 183] statuses, polygyny was the major symbol of high status. It is not unimportant to note also that the high incidence of both infant and adult mortality in the past led to the real danger that a monogamous man, despite his individual success in leadership, might have very few or no children living to adulthood and reproducing. Consequently, it was particularly necessary if a man reached any degree of prominence in the society, and especially if he had few or no issue, that he should take another wife in order to insure sufficient births for a large number of dependants."																															903	No	"A warrior who kills his antagonist and takes his scalp is considered a very brave man, but the war chief alone has the merit of the success of the enterprise, as well as the responsibility in case of any disaster by which he might lose a number of his men. Although he neither receives corporal punishment, nor is subjected to any public enquiry on his conduct, yet, he entirely loses the confidence of the nation and, consequently, falls into disgrace, unless he immediately retrieves his reputation by some extraordinary act of bravery against the enemies of his country, opportunities of which are never wanting."																															904	No	"The Sauteux have, properly speaking, no regular system of government, and but a very imperfect idea of the different ranks of society, so absolutely necessary in all civilized countries. Their leading men or chief magistrates are petty chiefs, whose dignity is hereditary, but whose authority is confined within the narrow circle of their own particular tribe or relations."																															905	No	"There are no established laws to enforce obedience; all is voluntary, and yet, such is their confidence and respect for their chiefs, that instances of mutiny or disobedience to orders are very rare among them. Those “great men” being considered as “Fathers” to their respective tribes, claim, as the Patriarchs of old, the same authority over their followers as fathers naturally have over their children."																															908	No	"The chief naturally assumed the command when the entire body of hunters went on the warpath; but this happened apparently only in times of extreme danger, as when an invasion of the Iroquois imperilled the lives of all the community. More often all the bands of Ojibwa within a certain area contributed a number of volunteers to a combined expedition, and each selected a leader ( meyosi) for its own contingent. One old Indian, Jim Nanibush, stated that before its departure the contingent held a dance lasting four days and four nights, and that the chief of the band, the medicine-men, and the warriors chose the leader at its conclusion. Another informant, Pegahmagabow, said that the medicine-men sometimes appointed the leader; the Great Spirit, they would declare, had ordained that a certain man should lead the warriors into battle. The region has not been troubled by wars for over a century, and the memories of the Indians have grown dim in the interval. Probably there were different ways of selecting a war-leader according to circumstances. Certainly a pusillanimous or inefficient chief would obtain few followers, whereas the Indians would voluntarily follow a warrior who had distinguished himself on previous occasions."																															909	No	"Girls who obtained visions during their periods of seclusion sometimes gained considerable influence in their bands, particularly if their visions seemed to call for participation in warfare and to promise them victory in battle. The forefathers of the Parry Islanders followed such women leaders with alacrity, believing that they enjoyed a twofold power, the mysterious power inherent in all women and the special supernatural power they derived from their visions."																															910	No	"As a universal rule, next to the liar, no one is so despised by the Indians as the narrow-hearted egotist and greedy miser. The Indians might possibly give a murderer or other sinner the seat of honour in their lodges, but a man known as a “sassagis” (mean man) must sit at the doorway. As long as a man has anything, according to the moral law of the Indians, he must share it with those who want; and no one can attain any degree of respect among them who does not do so most liberally. They are almost communists, and hence there are no rich men among them. Their chiefs and warriors live and behave much like the first barefooted kalifs, and they bestow all their gains on their followers. “Those vain scamps,” a man said to me, “whom you see here parading their silver medals and other European presents, are not the influential chiefs and great men among the Indians. They ridicule them. The right men conceal themselves, and are worse clothed than the others.” They give to the tribe not only what they obtain by the chase, but also all the presents they get from the Europeans, even to their tribute-money. Frequently, when a chief receives very handsome goods, either in exchange for his peltry, or as a recognition of his high position, he will throw them all in a heap, call his followers, and divide all among them. If he grow very zealous, he will pull off his shirt, give it away, and say, “So, you see, I have now nothing more to give; I am poorer than any one of you, and commend myself to your charity.”A man who lays up such capital in the hearts of his [Page 67] followers is thence much richer than if he had all the wares under lock and key. In case of need, all his followers blindly obey his orders."																															912	No	"The Ojibwe believed the natural leaders of their society were [Page 30] the mature and deliberative elders, men who had the experience of a lifetime and the objectivity of age to guide them. These elders were expected to exemplify in their political actions a sterling commitment to the Ojibwe political ethos, to consensus decision-making, to group cooperation, and to a non-coercive, non-authoritarian political style. The warriors, on the other hand, were perceived with considerably more ambivalence. They were young, rash, hot-headed, and inclined to be combative and coercive in interpersonal relations. Their behavior was in many ways completely opposite that of the civil leaders. Their rough and abrasive leadership style was considered appropriate to the realities of wartime, when lengthy, reasoned discussions of the options were obviously impossible. Such a leadership style was just as obviously undesirable in a village, however, where people sought group solidarity based on amicable interpersonal relations and avoided aggressive confrontations."																															913	No	"Each band was led by a senior male of the core family. Frequently, if not always, these individuals acted as the “trade-chiefs” (Bishop 1969; Cameron 1889–1890, 2:278). The position of leader appears to have been based on his ability to secure for his followers abundant trade goods, to excel as a hunter, and to command superior religious knowledge. Nevertheless, such individuals were charismatic, not autocratic leaders. Their followers could sever their allegiance at will (Bishop 1969:278–282)."																															914	No	"Formerly, each band had a leader. This role entailed certain obligations and responsibilities, such as the protection of followers from harm (i.e. witchcraft), caring for the sick and needy, settling intra-group differences, and giving feasts. The leader had certain rights, such as the assumption of a particular dress and the expectation of aid from his followers. Certain qualifications were required of the leader. He had to have superior religious power and had to adhere most closely to the norms of behavior considered by his people to be proper in political undertakings, economic situations, and religious performances. In these respects he epitomised the ideal person. His position was sanctioned by the fulfilment of such obligations as the distribution of goods and services, by means of his superior religious power, and through ties of kinship. The old leader, one might say, was a many sided person. His role was in fact a series of linked roles - political, economic, and religious in nature with the added dimension of kinship."																															915	No	"The leader's position is explicitly recognized in this connection through the fact that the other hunters turn over their kills of moose and caribou to him for distribution. He divides the meat received from other hunters and from his own kills, with the other members of the camp. The same is not true of the furs secured which are to be sold to the traders. Furs in general are the property of the individual who secures them. On occasion if the leader has trouble paying his debt with the trader, he is aided by others of the group. As far as is known, this takes place strictly along kinship lines. The leader is also in charge of any religious services that are held."																															916	No	"The leader's position is maintained, although weakly, in several ways. One means is through the distribution of meat which he and the others secure. Secondly, his position is sanctioned through kinship obligations and duties instilled in the members from birth. Thirdly, his senior age tends to assure him respect for his knowledge and superior wisdom. In this connection religious knowledge on the part of the leader is important. One informant claimed that he was leader although there was an older married man in the group, saying this was because he was a better worker (which was clearly not the case), and a leader in the church as his father had been (which was true). The leader is looked to for aid in mediating with the supernatural. It is his task to preserve the group from harm. Conversely, if his directions are not followed ill luck may [Page b81] plague those who do not conform to his wishes."																															917	No	"The Round Lake Ojibwa have no word strictly equivalent to the English “family” in the sense of a group of related people, a group of which any member might use the term “my family” referring to the same individuals. Instead, they use a term which in varied contexts refers to a group under the leadership of a particular person. The term nintipe˙ncike˙win, derived from nintipe˙ncike˙ “I lead, I boss,” means “those whom I lead” or “my followers.”"																															918	No	"Leadership could and did develop through consensus. As Peter Jones, the Mississauga Ojibwa, observed in considering the position of head chief, ‘their influence depends much on their wisdom, bravery and hospitality.’ Another Ojibwa, Kahgegagahbowh (George Copway), confirmed this belief: ‘They would not as brutes be whipped into duty. They would as men be persuaded to the right.’ He demonstrated how this was accomplished at a meeting of forty-eight chiefs from southern Ontario, when each was given an opportunity to speak at a grand council. 18 The vast majority of the group followed a leader only if they believed that the objectives were desirable and would benefit the whole community. A threatening external enemy, peer pressure, and individual conviction were among the few unifying forces. This was in sharp contrast with European political systems, which formulated policy from above and seldom took into consideration the wishes of individuals below. The Ojibwa could, and did, unite under a great war chief when the majority of the warriors saw the need for a sustained, unified effort — as they did against the Iroquois."																															919	No	"The chief was expected to set an example for his people in all areas. In times of scarcity, he had to be a good hunter and trapper to ensure the survival of those in need. He had to be spiritually knowledgeable and faithful in his personal comportment to community norms of behavior. He also had to come from a large and powerful clan group. All the qualities that determined his recruitment—his character, connections, and ability—also helped to maintain his incumbency, for there were no formal means by which he kept his job."																															920	No	"The position of chief entailed certain obligations and responsibilities. But because the chief's powers were limited, his duties were not onerous. He was expected to receive delegations from other communities, to deal with the Indian Agent over the security of treaty rights, to ensure that all band members had equal access to life-supporting resources, and to settle interfamily disputes, particularly over hunting and trapping territories. Above all, the chief was expected to keep in close touch with his people and help them with their problems."																															921	No	"Once chosen, the visionary was only a potential specialist. Only after demonstrating abilities did one actually become a leader. Ojibwa religious leadership was charismatic. People judged their leaders by their gifts, which were blessings from the manitos. One's claim to powers served no purpose unless those powers were evident.Furthermore, Ojibwas did not inherit religious powers (Schoolcraft 1853–1857, vol. 5: 423). There were no families of specialists; on the contrary, each extended family group contained one or more religious specialist who helped the entire group. These leaders were not people set apart from the rest of the group. Their powers were of degree, not kind. They simply were more powerful and better endowed than their fellows. Almost every Ojibwa was a visionary; the leader was the Ojibwa ideal: a highly successful visionary in a community of visionaries.The primary roles of religious leaders were curing, providing good health and long life to family members, divining, controlling weather, finding game and leading ceremonies. They buried the dead, admonished their fellows to uphold morality, and passed down myths and other oral traditions. Their chief functions lay in the area of maintaining community health. As herbal specialists, sucking doctors, djessakids and shamans, they prevented and fought all sorts of disease, through the powers granted them by the manitos.Curers and other religious leaders worked individually. There were no traditional Ojibwa medical or ceremonial societies, no associations of djessakids (Hoffman 1891: 157), no formal means of passing down the communities' religious knowledge, save the winter narration of myths. Generally each leader specialized in one area of doctoring or ritual knowledge. Women were known for their herbal recipes but they rarely acted as sucking doctors or djessakids. Each Ojibwa stepped into a role of leadership as his or her specialization was required by the community. Moreover, there existed no dichotomy between civil and religious authority. Indeed, there was no standing body of religious or political leadership among the Ojibwa peoples. Leaders arose in specific situations as they demonstrated their abilities."																															922	No	"One of the symbols of religious leadership prestige was polygyny (Kohl 1860: 111). The specialists tended to be exceptional hunters because of their rapport with the manitos and their hunting success enabled them to support large families. Male leaders took more than one wife to help tan the hides of slain animals and perform other domestic tasks. More to the point, male leaders took extra wives to show the community their ability to support them."																															923	No	"Because of the leaders' concern for their public image, they took easy offense to real or imagined insults. If the community slighted or mocked them, they took revenge through witchcraft, by creating the illnesses they were empowered to cure, by chasing away the game which they had the power to entice (Landes 1971: 53–59). Rival leaders attended one another's performances in order to learn each other's tricks and perhaps to expose a rival as fraudulent."																															924	No	"Ojibwas regarded their religious leaders with awe, respect, dependence and fear. Lahontan claimed that the Indians called their curers fools in their absence but called on them to heal the sick in times of disease (Lahontan 1703, vol. 2: 467). Ojibwas sought their leaders' opinions and ministrations but feared the very powers which made the leaders useful, since the leaders could cause as well as cure disease."																															925	No	"The influence of these wars extended beyond changesin material culture and the constituency of the tribe.Warfare, diplomacy, and the wealth derived from trade offered the means for individuals to gain prestige. Thedemands for revenge provided overt reasons for raidingwhile the tangible rewards of captured booty bore testimonyto the skill and valor of the leaders. Even the finalcessation of war in 1698 and a declared neutrality byEngland and France toward the Iroquois did not eliminatethe raiding, which had become an important aspectof the prestige system. Men found they could gain powerand prestige and achieve the status of Pine Tree chiefsthrough war. Young men followed proven leaders, and individuals with large followings were in a position toconvert prestige into power. Oneida leaders like theadopted Susquehannock warrior Shenandoah and DanielBread achieved prominence in this way. The resultwas an increase in the number of Pine Tree chiefs. Thisplaced an increasing strain upon the political structure ofOneida society as sachems and other tribal leaders foundit difficult to control the actions of young men. As a resulttwo factions emerged: a chief's faction that derivedpower from the clan mothers on the basis of the traditionalcomplex of beliefs and a warrior faction assertingpower based on their military prowess. While the warriorscould not assert their will in village affairs neithercould the village councilors or sachems command the warrior's obedience. The sachems, recognized as thelegitimate agents of the tribe by the French and British,relied in turn upon the warriors to implement anymilitary action. While the warriors had sufficient powerto ignore the dictates of their elders, they lacked a systemof beliefs that would validate their demands for power."																															926	No	"In addition to the position of hereditary chief (called variously sachem, peace chief, lord of the League, or federal chief) there were three categories of achieved chieftainships. A warrior might become a war chief through demonstrating bravery and leadership ability. Men of wisdom, intellectual superiority, or oratory skill might obtain pine tree chief status. Finally, men by virtue of age and wisdom could become chiefs of the village council. The achieved chieftainships terminated upon the [Page 46] death of the individual and were not passed on to others in the family. Originally, war chiefs and pine tree chiefs were advisers and counsellors to the sachems, but in time they assumed an equality with the sachems (Morgan 1969:71, 1870:99-101; Fenton 1961:269; see also Tooker 1964:43)."																															927	No	"If a nation such as the Iroquois, is not completely demoralized by defeat, certain leaders will be remembered for their feats of bravery, intelligence, capability, and astuteness. The Iroquois' participation in the various wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced great leaders, but, strangly enough from the white man's point of view, they are not immortalized to the extent that white men immortalize their heroes. The Tonawanda Indians were fond of pointing out to me that it is not the Indians' way to build monuments or carve statues of their heroes. There is no doubt that the Iroquois take pride in the demonstrated abilities of certain ancestors, but one rarely hears of these great leaders of the past. Paradoxically, it is the traitors in Iroquois history who are most often remembered. It seems to me that this apparent nonchalance toward the great leaders of the past is the ultimate recognition! Leaders, after all, were expected to perform capably. They achieved their leadership [Page 130] positions by demonstrating their ability beforehand. Therefore, warriors and leaders were by definition, brave and capable men. If one adequately fulfills the position no special merit is attached, since it is an inherent trait of the role. On the other hand, incompetents and traitors are specifically singled out and remembered for their failure to live up to the expectations and norms of their roles."																															928	No	"A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again."																															929	No	"Now, the Iroquois did not lack for communication; what they lacked was control. Power remained in the hands of local chiefs, and the latter in the course of history were not always the clan chiefs. They were war chiefs, and brilliant minds like Red Jacket who rose in national emergencies. In the minds of the Colonial officials and in the minds of the Indians, they were the chiefs of certain places."																															930	No	"In recapitulation, at the inter-village level, the Feast of the Dead entailed a distribution of goods in which chiefs distributed goods to the village youth, and other village members. The exchanges they received from their guests in no way replaced their outlays. The strategy was to distribute in excess of what one receives in order to honer one's dead. What is significant from an exchange viewpoint is that one's surplus is lost to other tribes in order to gain prestige for one's dead and invariably for oneself and one's own matrilineage. This strategy indicated that an ethic of hospitality was associated with the prestige system."																															931	No	"In aboriginal Iroquois society, the supernatural forces of rocks, the [Page 327] underground, various dieties, and a personal charm were conceptualized as controlling an individuals destiny. A political leader was thought to have authority because his magic was more powerful than his rivals. The powerful Onondaga chief Thadadaho was conceptualized as a sorcerer with snakes hair, who was able to control the wind. The prophet from the north overcame the Onondaga village headman because his good magic was stronger. "																															932	No	"Everett's report helped rekindle a movement among the Iroquois to assert their claims. Unfortunately, not all of the land claims activists were honest nor did they all have a completely beneficial or positive impact. Minnie Kellogg was the most influential of these individuals, having the intellectual qualities and educational training for great leadership. She had been born on the Oneida Indian Reservation near Green Bay on September 10, 1880. Her education included attendance at a boarding school at Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and later Stanford, Barnard, and the School of Philanthropy at Columbia University. In 1912, she married Orrin Joseph Kellogg, a non-Indian attorney from St. Paul, Minnesota. By that time, she had already become a politically active leader in Indian affairs as a vocal member of the Society of American Indians and as a writer. 36"																															933	No	"Despite her exceptional gifts -- a brilliant mind, beauty, selfconfidence, unusual oratorical abilities, and her educational attainments -- Kellogg is also the most controversial Iroquois leader of the twentieth century. It is clear from her many bizarre involvements that she misused her prodigious talents and/or was incapable of carrying out all the massive designs she had for her people's betterment. Although acknowledged today as a major force and brilliant person, she is accused by many Iroquois elders of swindling them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in her abortive efforts to bring their land claims to fruition and of creating debilitating factionalism that impeded tribal development for decades. Unfortunately, because of her questionable ethies and her inability to carry out what she espoused, Kellogg is blamed today for all that went wrong in Iroquois history in the interwar period. Consequently, her life story had the feel of a Greek tragedy: she wanted to use her extraordinary abilities to help her people but ended up accused by them of being a common outlaw."																															934	No	"Because of the prestige of building and dedicating a house, it was the ambition of every man to do so and thus become a house chief. Wealthy men were able to build or rebuild (or repair) a series of houses, often on the same site, thereby enhancing their personal status and honoring their dead relatives. As the house often received a new name, in addition to that of the [Page [p.294-b]] earlier structure, so its owner could claim another hereditary title for himself and bestow additional honorable names upon his grandchildren. The history of the Yakutat area and the fortunes of its lineages can be told in the history of its houses, their locations in the past, and the rosters of their chiefs."																															935	No	The possession of wealth by a sib or house chief imposed obligations of generosity																															936	No	"“The oldest person in the tribe [sib] . . . always got a big respect. He just the head of it all the time. They always take him as next to the chief. They always respect the oldest one. The older he is, the more respect. Even if he’s poor . . . ha cuqadéqa—‘the head person.’ The tribe always get advice from him. ‘Adviser’—because he’s the oldest. He know more than the young people. ‘The wisest.’ What I don’t know, I’m going to ask him. Then he tells me. He knows everything.”"																															937	No	"The higher the rank of the individual and the greater the consequent responsibilities, the more stress was set upon wisdom, judgment, and education. This was especially true for the sib chief, who was responsible for his people’s welfare. In making decisions, he often or usually consulted with the house chiefs, those “next to him,” who were like members of his council, and also with the sib elder. However, his word alone could command respect, not only because of the actual political power he wielded and because of his own high rank, but also because he was known to be well educated and therefore wise. But even the chief should not be too proud to take advice from an inferior. This was the lesson that Chief Shakes of Wrangell, one of the noblest and richest chiefs, and “next to Solomon, one of the smartest men that ever lived,” had to learn from experience (see “The Moral of Chief Shakes” pp. 894-895)."																															938	No	"“A person have to learn all the stories before he become to a chief, a tribe leader. No matter how rich he is, a person can’t be a chief if he don’t know all the [Page [p.466-a]] stories from the different tribes, unless he knows all the stories from all the tribes in Alaska.” He could, however, become a house or lineage chief."																															939	No	"There were other accomplishments which brought respect and which were therefore deemed appropriate to aristocrats, as well as to others. These included skill in hunting, and since chiefs either led or ordered major hunting expeditions, it was desirable that they should be experts in the habits of animals and in foretelling the weather. Chief Yaxodaqet used a Russian peg calendar to predict the movements of migratory animals and birds. “The weather he tells—gankAnigi. He knows it. Yaxodaqet [the first one] was an expert. . . . And then his nephew [was] just as good because he learn it from him. . . . And then his grandson—that’s Olaf’s grandfather—he’s just as good. And his nephew, Chief George, is good. But after Chief George, we’re among the White people already, work in the cannery. He died just the year the cannery started [1902]. There’s no more sea otter hunting, and nobody learn from him.”"																															940	No	"A chief might have shamanistic powers, in fact some house chiefs were actually shamans, and certainly some close relatives of sib chiefs were famous doctors. Such persons commanded great respect, tinged with awe or even fear. Artistic ability was also admired and several house chiefs are mentioned as having carved house posts or painted screens, and Dry Bay Chief George was noted as a song composer. Women skilled at weaving baskets and blankets were respected, and presumably aristocratic girls were trained in fancy work. Industry was continually stressed as a virtue, although it was perhaps supposed to manifest itself in somewhat different occupations for the rich and high-born than for the poor and humble."																															941	No	"Succession to this chieftainship is hereditary within his lineage. Through generations of authority, greater wealth, and a strict observance of established etiquette, these aristocrats have become distinguished by their dignity, intelligence, and address. Their social position is inherited but must be maintained by the giving of elaborate feasts, distributions of property, and by marriage only with their equals. Thus in 1885, when Anna hootz [[unknown]Anaxú[unknown]c, “-?- brown bear”], the chief of the Sitka Karqwantan [Ka[unknown]g w -a[unknown]nta[unknown]n, Wolf 1], contracted what was considered to be a mesalliance with a woman of the lower class, the two chiefs, [Page 38]"																															942	No	"Although the office of chief was the most honorable among the Tlingit, the holder was possessed of limited authority. His power was more moral than real, for the people constituted the governing body. He presided over them in council and represented them in dealing with outsiders, but he governed only through their consent. [Some clan chiefs and lineage heads were also shamans, and as such had considerable influence.]The duties of the chief were to lead his clan in war, to represent the clan at all functions, to preside over its councils, to entertain strangers, to assist the needy and provide the death feast for those clansmen who had nothing, to arbitrate disputes and settle differences within the clan."																															943	No	"If the social position of the killer was not equal to that of the victim, the life of another person, or of two or more of a lower social rank, wholly innocent of the offense, might have to be given as an equivalent. Thus, Dick [ Satan? ] reported that high-class people’s lives were of more value than the lives of the people at large. The value of a chief’s life could not be atoned for by the life of another. While a chief’s life might be worth ten or fifteen slaves, a common person’s life might be about five slaves, or four hundred blankets. Adjustments for an injury might be made by a consultation in which both families were equally represented and agreed upon an award. [In case of a killing] the aggressor or one of his family might offer his life in atonement, but if no reparation were made, the result would be a feud which would never be forgotten, but would be inherited as a duty for generations. These feuds greatly influenced the social relations of the whole people. "																															944	No	"The reason why the leader always seems so anxious about his guests, for fear of any trouble among themselves. If there is serious trouble among the guests, the leader [host] is to be blamed for it.]"																															945	No	"Those invited select two leaders for the songs and dances which they practice every night when they camp [on the way to the potlatch]. These leaders must fast for two days and keep away from women. It was the invariable custom that visitors, whether invited or not, should never come directly to a strange village, but should land and camp the preceding night at some distance, the place being designated by the host’s friends, who met them bringing food."																															946	No	"Two or more families of the opposite phratry, either of this or another tribe, were always invited to a potlatch. They were divided into two sides that competed with each other in songs and dances, and so keen was this rivalry that it took the greatest tact on the part of the leaders to prevent clashes ending in bloodshed. [Perhaps because rivalry between two groups of guests was most acute at the major intertribal potlatches, Emmons discussed guest rivalry only in this connection.]"																															947	No	"Although from the outside, Tlingit society seemed to be rigidly hierarchical, with an individual ranked in his house, a house ranked in a clan, and to some extent, a clan ranked in the moiety, such ranking was never permanent or even especially predictable. Neither did those at the top of the hierarchy have much power over individuals outside their house. A yitsati did control the members of his house, who were expected to follow his orders without question. However, the clan chief did not apparently enjoy such power, since he could only urge his fellow yitsati to act in a certain way, there not being any institutionalized rule insisting that they had to. And even though the two clan chiefs of the highest ranking clans in each moiety were sometimes referred to as the “village chiefs,” they had no real authority over the village as a whole; all they had was tremendous prestige and thus a certain amount of influence over the group (Oberg 1973: 42). Since the individual’s primary loyalty was to his house, his interest and commitment to “leaders” who were ranked above him but not closely related to him were minimal."																															948	No	"The third critical aspect of the Tlingit potlatch concerns the uncertainty surrounding leadership succession, the rules for which were not fixed. As Rosman and Rubel (1971: 203) state, “where there is no fixity in the rule of [Page 48] succession, claimants to position are forced to demonstrate their political abilities in lining up support. Since the means of asserting one’s claim is through potlatching, the successful claimant must transform his political support into the wherewithal to potlatch and validate his succession to position.” In effect, the Tlingit potlatch was a ritual of exchange that assured the continuation of society at the juncture of three crises: death, payment, and succession. It was, in other words, a rite of passage."																															949	No	"To make sense of the nature of Tlingit social stratification, one must begin by evaluating the earliest descriptions of that society, made in the first half of the nineteenth century, before it was seriously affected by contact with the Europeans and especially the Americans. Despite their biases, a number of early Russian observers made insightful comments on the subject. Thus Langsdorff, who visited several Tlingit communities in the early 1800s, saw chiefship and high rank being based on achievement rather than ascription. In his words,age, superiority of natural understanding, or temporal wealth . . . or the great numbers of persons of which a family consists—these seem to be the requisites for obtaining respect and distinction among the Tlingit. The proper designation of a chief among them seems to be the head of a numerous family; he exercises unlimited power over all the branches and members of it, they are his subjects. . . . (1814, vol. 2:129-130; italics mine)Lisianskii, who visited Sitka during the same period, agreed with this view, when he said that, despite the inheritance of property “from uncle to nephew,” the position of leadership usually went to the “strongest man and the one who had more relatives.” However, in contrast to Langsdorff, he thought that the chiefs’ authority over their subjects was rather limited ([1812] 1947:216)."																															950	No	"Comments like these suggest that the leadership position and aristocratic status in Tlingit society were based on a combination of ascription and achievement, with the headman’s pedigree and wealth, as well as the size of the kinship group under his authority, being the key factors determining his rank and status. It also appears that his control over his kin was rather limited."																															951	No	"Krause, a German naturalist who spent an entire winter in the early 1880s in a northern Tlingit village and visited several others further south, reiterated the views of his Russian predecessors and emphasized the crucial role played by aristocrats in ceremonial life. In his words,The power of the [clan] chief is very limited and the direction which it takes depends on the personality of the individual. Only in cooperative undertakings and in council is he a leader, in everything else every family head is entirely free to do anything which is not counter to custom and which does not infringe on the rights of others. . . . Also the so-called aristocracy does not possess any particular privileges except the high esteem in which they are held by their tribesmen. At feasts they are given places of honor and the richest presents are given to them. For the death or injury of an important person greater compensation is demanded than for a person of lesser rank; two or more lives being payment for one chief. (1956:77-84)"																															952	No	"Similar to the chief’s political authority, his role in the economy was a function of his kinship seniority. In the absence of force-sanctioned surplus extraction mechanisms, his capacity to draw resources to himself depended upon normal mechanisms of kinship prestations and exchanges. Although chiefs had a certain regulatory role in production and were the ultimate titular owners of all the land, they, as well as the aristocracy in general, did not have actual control over the distribution of the means of production (primarily land), or over the actual execution of production. However, within the distribution system the chief was focal. Surplus food and other types of wealth were given to him by his kinsmen, and he in turn redistributed most of it through the structure of the kin group. Redistribution was one of the most important duties and privileges of chiefship in Polynesia; it demonstrated the chief’s power in terms of his ability to command resources from a wide group, as well as his leadership qualities, in the sense that his wide distributions appeared as generosity, and as concern of the welfare of his entire kin group (Ortner 1981:364)."																															953	No	"Despite occasional violations of the fundamental principle of mutual help between the leaders of a matrilineal group and the rest of its members, it appears that the latter strongly identified with the former. The prestige of the head of a house or clan became their entire group’s collective prestige. The chiefs and the aanyátx’i could not afford to neglect their matrikin. The ordinary members of a matrilineal group could always refuse to help their leader in a potlatch or a war raid he was organizing, thus ruining his chances of maintaining or raising his status. The dissatisfied commoners could also join a junior relative of the chief who resented his authority and tried to establish an offshoot house of his own (see below). Thus, the nobles and the commoners existed in a symbiotic relationship, in which the former exchanged their ritual expertise and esoteric knowledge for the latter’s labor and active assistance in potlatches and other ceremonies."																															954	No	"Other important criteria for selecting the incumbent’s successor included leadership potential, eloquence, high morality, wisdom, and the knowledge of the sacred traditions of his own and other matrilineal groups. According to Olson, a potential heir who was rich would be preferred over one who was merely wise and the wise one would be appointed speaker. “Yet in the native mind this would be an extremely unlikely situation, for if a man is wise he will also be wealthy!” (1967:6)."																															955	No	"Weaker quasi-groups try to build support by consistently attacking the leaders of the other quasi-groups and trying to [Page 278] demonstrato that a new leadership is necessary. Of ten these weaker leaders have offices in voluntary organizations and they use these to provide prestigious positions for supporters and to publically state their case on how the town or organization is being ill-run. This is generally low keyed and there is no appearance of real confliot. In other words, there is no indication that anything is about to change. The weaker leaders build for an uncertain future time."																															956	No	"At times a weaker leader deoides to chellenge the dominance of the stronger quasi-group and, at this time, quasi-groups tend to re-form into two factions. Factions are short-lived phenomena (Bujra 1973:34, Nicholas 1965:28) which appear in situations of conflict. According to Nicholas (1965:27): “Factions are conflict groups....conflict explains why there is no such thing as one faction in any political arona; obviously, there must always be at least two factions.” During the 1971 town election there was a faction based in Family B competing with one based in Family A. After its devastating defeat, the first effectively disbanded as a political action unit, although some core followers remained loyal to the leader. Since the, the second has continued to function in the more generalized form of quasi-group that it had before the conflict. "																															957	No	"es. In the homes of the wealthy chiefs, every girl had a slave woman as servant-maid. At puberty, a girl, in the past, went through a period of seclusion ranging from four months to one year, after which she was carefully guarded by her parents until she was taken in marriage by a man of equal or greater rank."																															958	No	"Status, on the other hand, is of great importance in the organization of labor. While the yitsati initiates all important activities, he tends to abstain from the more strenuous forms of common labor. He never gathers wood nor carries water, nor is he ever seen preparing food. As his position is primarily a ceremonial one, he is careful not to endanger his prestige nor that of his house by doing menial tasks. His chief economic function is to decide when it is best to go hunting, or to begin the salmon harvest, or to go to prepare oil. This he does by watching the 86 position of the sun. When it [Page 76] has passed certain landmarks, then it is time to undertake the various economic activities. The yitsati is also the judge of quality in foods, especially in oils. In the old days each house tried to make the best oil, and each yitsati had his special formula for oil making, which consisted largely in letting the fish decay for a certain length of time before rendering the oil."																															959	No	"The ankaua is not a war leader, but he takes an active part in all ceremonial matters concerning his clan. When clan disputes are to be discussed, the ankaua calls the various yitsati together and they hold a meeting in a sweat house, taking a steam bath and discussing clan affairs at the same time."																															960	No	"In the case of the yitsati (keeper of the house), a formalized way of showing respect was through a food gift given to him by the young men of the house. We have already spoken of the individual hunting and fishing, and even today it is always the custom for a hunter or a fisherman to give the house chief a portion of his bag or catch. The question of amount is left entirely to the giver. The economic function of this food gift is to provide the yitsati with luxury foods which he cannot procure for himself owing to the fact that he is a ceremonial leader and not a hunter or fisherman. The yitsati, in turn, rewards the giver by taking a personal interest in his private affairs. Furthermore, there is the factor of the yitsati’s social position in the house-group which is kept before the minds of the others by these formal gifts of food."																															961	No	"To the Tlingit, rank and prestige are of primary importance, and the getting of this social value is dependent upon co-operation. No house chief is able to give a great potlatch without the help of the other houses of his clan. While the primary motive is one of personal prestige and power, in actual practice it becomes translated into clan prestige and clan power. The clan crest is the symbol which combines the ambitions of the individual with those of his group; to elevate yourself you elevate your clan."																															962	No	"Each household leader ( hitsati ) served on the local clan council headed by the ranking household leader known as the ashadi huny, the one “standing at the head.” Oberg (1937:40-41) incorrectly uses the general term ankaua, which means a wealthy person, as the title of a local clan leader. Most political functions of the local clan were handled by the clan head in consultation with his elders. At the household level political participation was open to all married male members; at the local clan level political participation was indirect through the household representative. Most local clan political decisions were made by the clan head in consultation with his council elders. The ranking clan leader’s household functioned as the sociopolitical axis of the local clan (Oberg 1937: 39). An elder from Chatham Straits explained, “in the olden times we lived in large community houses with the floors cut down in three steps (tiers). Approximately fifty people lived in each house. A sub-chief was over each house and a head chief was over several houses. All the houses in a village belonged to one group (local clan).” Another Tlingit stated that when “the council of house chiefs got together and they decided on something, then that’s the way it is to be.”A clan chief administered his responsibilities more by the power of persuasion, status of rank, influence of wealth, and strength of character than through the threat or use of power. His responsibilities pertained primarily to interhousehold and interclan affairs. He consulted with his council of advisers in matters pertaining to the settlement of conflicts among intraclan households or in the consideration of raids or potlatches with other clans (Oberg 1937:39). At a potlatch the clan leader served as host and dispenser of many gifts, but he did so with the consent of his people and the contributions of his clan. The contributions by clan members were later repaid by the clan head when he distributed the gifts received during a return potlatch. Peratrovich (1959:127) described the process of initiating a potlatch for a totem pole. The males of the clan would assemble to discuss the arrangements: the amount of food needed, the guest [Page 24] list, the distribution of the gifts, and the payment to the carver. 6 The chief reminded the men of the responsibility they had as citizens of the clan “to erect a pole in accordance with the established customs of the people.” Bound by the traditions of the past and wishes of the chief, the men undertook the responsibilities of securing an appropriate log, contacting a reputable carver, and serving at the forthcoming feast."																															963	No	"The political innovation that developed in conjunction with the emergence of consolidated clan villages was the affiliated clan council within each moiety. A general organizational principle permeating all levels of Tlingit society is that “someone is always in charge,” explained a consolidated village chief. Within each household, localized clan (even a dispersed clan upon occasion), moiety village, and consolidated village, one individual is always the recognized leader. In a military-oriented society like the Tlingit, this is not only logical, it is a vital strategic necessity. One elder explained, “Thus in times of crises the chain of command was clear.” The role of the consolidated village chief in warfare and potlatching illustrates this principle. During periods of hostilities the household head or clan head was in charge of his war canoe and served as a “company commander.” The host chief of the affiliated Raven or Eagle Moieties functioned as the “village general.” “The head-chief is not hesitant to consult with the sub-chiefs in order to acquire the best possible decision,” commented the elder. “In the case of potlatch ceremonies,” he continued, “the head-chief is the keynote speaker at all times. The sub-chiefs make supportive speeches.” At one of the potlatches attended by the writer, one of the sub-chiefs stated in his speech that he would turn the next part of the evening’s events over to “our commander-in-chief,” that is, the keynote speaker for the affiliated Raven Clans. The phrase “our commander-in-chief” was the translation of the Tlingit term used in the speech and explained by the sub-chief to the writer on the following day."																															964	No	"Goldschmidt and Haas (1946:4) attributed the position of leadership to wealth acquired through the control of property. Olson (1967:6) stated that the selection of a household head was based on “wealth and wisdom.” After the death of a chief, the clan preferred a candidate who had attained the age of 35, in the belief that by this age the personality of the person had acquired sufficient stability and maturity to enable the group to make a good choice. A Tlingit explained, “You don’t choose a leader so much as you recognize the innate ability for leadership.”"																															965	No	"While all clan members contributed to the prestige of the clan chief, the “nephews” and slaves were the real measure of his actual authority (Averkieva 1966:75; Garfield and Wingert 1966:29; Krause 1956 [1885]:111; Olson 1967:49; Petrov 1882:166). Swanton (1908:449) states, “revenge for the death of someone for whom no payment had been made and desire to obtain slaves in order to increase the power of the chief and his clan [were] the commonest incentives to war.” Chief Katlean who headed up the powerful Kiksadi Clan of Sitka reportedly announced “that he could force the other chiefs into the agreement” to permit Baronof to establish a Russian trading post at Sitka (Bancroft 1886:368). Powerful and wealthy chiefs seem to have exerted considerable influence in regional affairs."																															966	No	"Ethnologists also admit that local bands, by their very nature, were fluid. While the local band consisted of closely related kin, members of a band could, and frequently did, change affiliation. Poorly equipped to control violence once it had broken out, small face-to-face societies used various informal mechanisms to encourage consensus and to maintain order. One important device for relieving tension and separating conflicting elements within nomadic communities was the seasonal concentration and dispersal of local bands. Any person or family could take advantage of the periodic dispersal of bands to leave, either temporarily or permanently, a stressful situation. Colin M. Turnbull has argued that, within band societies, ’the process of fission and fusion follows lines of dissent rather than those of descent, and that the major function is conflict-resolving.‘ 8 Thus, a sentimental kinship could substitute for a close biological kinship to tie band members together, but consensus was essential. With each person enjoying complete freedom to move from band to band, ’those bands that had particularly good leaders or seemed to be constantly lucky in the hunt [Page 4] attracted people from other bands... Others that experienced misfortunes sometimes disappeared completely as their members gradually drifted to other groups.‘ 9"																															967	No	"Horses not only allowed the Blackfoot to defend themselves against their enemies but brought about important changes within Blackfoot society. The nature of Blackfoot social and political leadership changed dramatically with the arrival of the horse. Thereafter, the size of a person‘s horse herd, not to mention his horse raiding and riding skills, would be among those attributes that determined his position in society. 1414 During the first decade of the nineteenth century, Alexander Henry the Younger, noted that the richest men among the Siksika had up to fifty horses. Peigan chiefs had up to three hundred; Barry M. Gough, ed., The Journal of Alexander Henry the Younger, 1799-1814, vol. 2 (Toronto: Champlain Society 1992), 378. Other attributes, including one‘s generosity, continued to be important in establishing status. A man who did not share his wealth was scorned, not admired, by his kin. Gough‘s version of Alexander Henry the Younger‘s journals must be considered the new standard because it is the more complete and accurate transcription of the original. Elliot Coues, ed., New Light on the Early History of the Greater Northwest: The Manuscript Journals of Alexander Henry [the ’Younger], Fur Traders of the North West Company, and of David Thompson, 1799-1814 (1897; Minneapolis: Ross & Haines 1965), remains useful for its annotations.Equestrian Blackfoot society was not as egalitarian as pedestrian Blackfoot society"																															968	No	"As local communities grew, so did the complexity of Blackfoot society and the potential influence one man could have. A band leader could influence his now larger local band, and, since horses also eased communication among bands, he could exert greater influence beyond his band. 17"																															969	No	"Once the animals had been “called” to the gathering basin, it was the task of a few chosen young men to lure the animals toward the pound or jump. There, men and boys slaughtered the animals (sometimes with the help of women and children). Everyone joined in the butchering (Ewers 1958:80; Verbicky-Todd 1984:50-51). Once the animals had been skinned and cut up, it became the responsibility of a “chief” to distribute the meat and hides. Each family received a portion in accordance with its size, although the ceremonialists who had led the iniskim ritual usually received special parts (Dempsey 1957) and the robes and ribs were given to men (Old Weasel Tail, quoted by Ewers 1958:11-13). Considerable pressure was placed on the “chief” to distribute the meat and robes fairly; a number of legends or myths tell of leaders left alone or killed for being stingy."																															971	No	"Council meetings were usually attended by the head chief, the war chief, and the heads of leading families. Decisions were made by consensus, rather than by majority vote, and the head chief seldom tried to give direct orders to the other councillors. He knew they were too proud and independent to be intimidated and that they could always withdraw from the camp if they disagreed with him. Instead, the head chief tried to win [Page 412] adherents through oratory; when he felt that he had enough support, he would announce his own intentions. If there was a dispute as to whether the camp should move north or south, the chief might present his arguments, gain support, and then say that he was going south. He did not order the others to follow, but he knew that they probably would go with him."																															972	No	"The Piegans—if not the other tribes also—then had a civil chief and a war chief. The former was renowned for his eloquence, the latter for his success in leading large war parties. Both held limited authority. They, as well as the chiefs of hunting bands, were leaders only by the consent and will of their people. They “had no power beyond their influence, which would immediately cease by any act of authority and they are all very careful not to arrogate any superiority over others.” 43"																															974	No	"Frequent camp movements during spring, summer, and fall required that Blackfoot Indian homes be portable and that their household furnishings and ceremonial equipment be easily and efficiently packaged. The head chief, with the advice of the band chiefs, determined the movements of the great tribal camp in summer. He sent his herald around the camp circle the night before a move was to be made to tell the people to be ready to get under way early the next morning. In the much smaller band camps during spring and fall the band chief consulted with other prominent men of his band before announcing a move."																															975	No	"Wealth brought both opportunity and responsibility to the man who possessed it. The stingy rich man was despised by his less fortunate fellows. The generous man of wealth was beloved by them. If he was liberal in feasting and in giving away food and horses to the needy, if he lent horses to the poor for their use in hunting and moving camp, his fellow band members would want him for their chief—provided he also possessed a fine war record. James Doty described the Blackfoot chieftaincy thus in 1854:Every man who can acquire a large herd of horses, keep a good Lodge and make a large trade in Buffalo Robes is a chief, and he will maintain a persuasive influence over his people just so long as he continues wealthy, and ministers to the popular voice in directing the movements of the camp, leading war parties etc. Whenever he opposes his wishes to those of his band, it will desert him and turn to some chief more pliable. 5"																															976	No	"Before setting out on a raid, the party was supposed to obtain permission of the band chief, who was thus informed of their destination and objective. They would not do it, however, if they believed he might object to their venture. On the evening before departure the prospective raiders walked around camp drumming on a piece of buffalo rawhide and singing their wolf (war) songs. Their friends and relatives gave them food and extra moccasins to take on their journey. Other young men, upon hearing their drumming, might ask to join the party. The leader [Page 129] would refuse their requests if he thought they were unreliable or if he believed his party was large enough. Most horse-raiding parties were small, comprising less than a dozen men. Many leaders did not want large parties, for they were too difficult to command and to conceal from enemy eyes. Occasionally, parties of fifty or more men did raid for horses. Rarely, too, two or three men set out on one of these perilous quests."																															977	No	"As David Thompson observed a century and a half ago, stinginess was a trait detested by the Blackfoot. He noted that the “tent of a sick man is well supplied” after a chase, and that deaths from hunger were very rare (Thompson, 1916, pp. 355-356). One of the recognized responsibilities of band leadership among the Blackfoot was that of feeding the poor."																															978	No	"Generous giving of horses, secured at great risk from enemy camps, was regarded as a praiseworthy act. He who, in the intoxication of success, gave away all the horses he had taken without thought for himself, was remembered for his generosity long after the gifts were distributed. Action of that kind served as a steppingstone to leadership. It was customary for a person who had received a captured horse as a gift to aid the donor in preparing for future raids through presents of moccasins, food, ammunition, or even a gun, if the young man did not possess one. 36"																															979	No	"The position of a chief was neither hereditary nor elective, but wholly selfcreative. The young man ambitious of this distinction sought to be conspicuous for energy and daring in war, intelligence in council, and liberality in giving feasts and providing tobacco for the guests of his lodge. The exhibition of these qualities in more than ordinary degree would win him the respect and confidence of one after another of his band, who were ready to follow his guidance and accept his council. When this point was reached he began to have influence and be regarded as a leader or chief. Practice in obtaining popularity was usually productive of skill in retaining it, and once a chief the distinction was pretty certain to attach for life. The greatness or authority of a chief depended wholly upon his popularity, upon the proportion of the tribe whose confidence could be won and adhesion secured. The number of chiefs that might be in a band was dependent simply upon the number who could secure this following. This system did not necessarily array the members of a band into opposing factions, for several chiefs might enjoy the equal consideration of all."																															980	No	"Discussions of the band chieftaincy by later investigators among the Blackfoot, Grinnell (1892, p. 219) and Wissler (1911, pp. 22-23), confirm Bradley’s keen analysis, as does the testimony of my informants. The latter insisted that the major requirements for band leadership were (1) an outstanding, proved war record and (2) a reputation for generosity. Some contended that no man was recognized as a band chief unless he had taken a gun from the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, the highest war honor. Lazy Boy could recall a single exception to this requirement among the Piegan. Night Shoot was an experienced horse raider, although his record of coups was not outstanding. He brought home many horses and distributed them liberally among the members of his band. He was very generous and well liked, and became a band chief by popular demand."																															981	No	It is certain that the requirement of outstanding war achievement for band leadership had social value. It insured that men who rose to power in the band were brave and experienced warriors qualified to lead in the formulation of plans for the protection of the band and revenge of enemy action against it. In an atmosphere of almost constant warfare with neighboring tribes it was necessary that political leaders be warriors of proved mettle.																															982	No	"Informants indicated that poor people were the most migratory in their band affiliations. They became camp followers of the leader [Page 248] who seemed to be most able and willing to supply them with their basic needs, food and/or horses for hunting and moving camp. Sometimes these mendicants became so numerous that their demands were too great a drain upon the resources of the band chief. Should he fail to provide for them he would surely lose some of his followers, who would either champion the candidacy of another leader within the band or find residence in another band led by a man who appeared to be more affluent. Care of the poor was a recognized responsibility of the band chief. Should he fail in this his leadership was seriously threatened. 79"																															983	No	"The old society, despite its basically competitive character, required considerable cooperation in order to function at all. Buffalo hunting, the essential economy, depended on communal effort and group discipline. Effective policing demanded a continuing solidarity within the men’s societies. The need for joint defence encouraged neighborliness and restraint within the camp circle. A leader to win enduring support had to be generous. A follower to earn a just reward had to be loyal."																															984	No	"It is said that there was another way to get the buffalo into this chute. A man who was very skilful in arousing the buffalo’s curiosity, might go out without disguise, and by wheeling round and round in front of the herd, appearing and disappearing, would induce them to move toward him, when it was easy to entice them into the chute. Once there, the people began to rise up behind them, shouting and waving their robes, and the now terror-stricken animals rushed ahead, and were driven over the cliff into the pis′kun, where all were quickly killed and divided among the people, the chiefs and the leading warrior getting the best and fattest animals."																															985	No	"The age-grading of the males in father’s family is the analogue of a broad practice of emphasizing senior authority among the Northern Blackfoot. On the testing ground of juvenile games the older boys directed the ordeals for the younger ones. On the warpath the elder initiated the party, assumed leadership on the march and divided the spoils. Indeed, an older warrior, [Page 13] war deeds and political authority being equal, would ordinarily not join a war expedition led by one who was his junior. Among war chiefs who had already made their major coups, seniority was as important a factor in prestige as the number of major coups."																															987	No	"It is true, as we noted in Chapter I, that the bands in their buffalo-day structure were broken up, reformed, and dissipated during the years of reserve life. It is also true that the importance of war deeds as a primary requisite for band chieftainship disappeared. “Authentic” chiefs whose resistance to white ways reacted to the economic detriment of their bands lost followers to energetic younger men who profited from haying and cattle raising. People went where they could best be provided for, whether the provider had taken a gun in battle or not. However, the original, basic, social organization continued with the responsibility on the shoulders of a wealthy and generous head-man who protected the interests of his followers and concerned himself with their welfare."																															988	No	"The term “pressure group” implies the possibility of forcing men into the council who are not properly qualified for the position. While this must be conceded as a possibility, the stringency of the [Page 133] Blackfoot criteria of chiefly behaviour tends to eliminate those who have no genuine urge to work for tribal welfare. When a boy is just out of school, he enters upon an initial period of striving to make a living. Aided by the agency and relatives, he marries and takes up farming. To become chief, he must show energy and persistence enough to bring some sort of tangible return. This has striking parallels with the old war-pattern and the related validation of supernatural powers, for both paths require persistence, and both are publicly recognized only in terms of tangible results. Indeed this parallel seems to be recognized by Indians, as indicated by the statement of an informant:"																															989	No	"Yet merely to amass wealth is inadequate. One must also be generous and “kind-hearted,” which means giving time, energy, and service in behalf of the Indians. One must not only have a cutter and binder for one’s grain crop but be willing to lend them to a needy person. If a neighbour needs a hand stacking the bundles of wheat after borrowing the cutter and binder, one should lend a hand. For all visitors coming to the house, there should be a bowl of tea or even a plate of meat. As mentioned before in the chapter on economy, chiefs are under special obligations of generosity, but most important for the elected chief is that the circle of recipients be expanded beyond the kinsmen. This wider demand clearly shows the difference between the elected chief and the entrepreneur type of chief who needs only to look after his immediate circle of followers."																															990	No	"As a chief you have to see that other people get enough and you get less. You defer to others in selecting your personal area for haying and for remunerative odd jobs provided by the agent.There are also certain rules of conduct. A chief should act with dignity—when an agent dismissed certain chiefs for drunkenness and immorality, it was with the approval of many Indians. To gamble is also regarded disapprovingly, although chiefs may participate in ceremonial hand games."																															992	No	"The band chief had a lot of influence in the tribe, but he also carried a tremendous weight of responsibility. Not only did he sit at the head of the council of war chiefs of his band, but he made decisions regarding where and when the camp would be moved, where and when the buffalo hunts would take place, etc. It was also the responsibility of the band chief to see to it that when the camp moved, all persons, including the aged and the infirm, were provided with horses so that they would be able to move their belongings at a pace that would not delay the group in general. This was why horses were so important to the Blackfoots, and why the ability [Page 179] to steal horses from the enemy was the primary key to social and political advancement among all the Plains Tribes. It is also of importance to know that not only was a chief expected to be able to obtain horses and guns from the enemy, he was expected to be very generous in loaning or giving these articles to those who lacked them. Especially the head or civil chiefs were often quite poor simply because they had given so much of their material accumulation to other persons. This great burden of obligation which the civil chief bore in the name of his people was one reason that some war chiefs actually refused to accept the position of civil chief: they were too stingy, and of course when this fact became known the tribe would not have retained them as civil chiefs anyway. Generosity is still highly regarded among the Blackfoots, and even today the stingy Indian is regarded with contempt."																															993	No	"I fully believe that the Chief has the native intelligence to make Phi Beta Kappa at any university (although, since scholastic honors are awarded not for intelligence or achievement but for lucubration and conformity, the Chief would probably have ended up with a B average like the rest of us), and I was aware that in his mood of silent contemplation he was clarifying in his own mind some issue of importance. Many elderly persons are so bound up in the past that they cannot function in contemporary situations, but not so the Chief. He is a remarkably perspicacious (and perspicuous) individual, and he is fully and intelligently aware of the problems with which the Blackfoot Indian of today must deal—and he is aware that these problems must be resolved on a long-term basis."																															994	No	"The organization of a raiding party was a purely individual affair. A party was organized by the man who wished to be the leader. He notified a number of carefully selected men of his intentions and arranged for a meeting at which the plans would be discussed. Participation in a raiding party was determined by rank, equipment, and the relationship to the leader. The party normally was composed of members of one band; brothers and brothers-in-law were a favorite raiding unit for they could thereby keep the horses in the family. The leader never invited a man superior to him in war record nor would such a man raid under him. Similarly, a poor man would not attempt to lead a group of wealthier men, even though they were younger. 173 A man of high status, whether it be in terms of war record, [Page 56] wealth in horses or the ownership of medicine bundles, would refuse to be led by one of lower standing. Not only were the poor rarely leaders, but they often had difficulty in joining a raiding party, for participation was limited to those who had the necessary equipment—a gun, powder and ammunition, a good supply of moccasins, dried provisions, protective war charms, and, when the party went on horse, a good horse.With adequate skill, any member of the tribe could produce the equipment necessary for the early type of warfare, but the new equipment, guns and ammunition, could be purchased from the trading posts only by those who had a surplus of horses, dried provisions or hides. This put the poor at a distinct disadvantage, and was a check upon vertical mobility. This also gave a new paternalistic role to the chief as a distributor of valuable goods."																															995	No	"The function of the leader consisted mainly in enforcing simple precautionary rules, such as prohibiting a fire for cooking, or the shooting of game once in enemy territory. Every party had one or two scouts who reported to the leader. When the party neared the camp of the enemy the leader decided who was to do the raiding. If the party was small it would break up, every man for himself, and arrange to meet at an appointed spot. In other cases, the leader ordered some to stay, usually the inexperienced or the poorer ones, while the leader, alone or with a choice few, went for the horses. This rear guard duty was resented for there was a possibility that they would not be allowed to share the loot. The chief might present them with a horse, a gift which they were expected to acknowledge at the victory dance. 174174 J. Richardson, Mss.Many parties broke up because of this, those ordered to remain behind often disobeying and going out for their own horses. In cases where the party was mounted and had ambushed the enemy, this individualism was even more marked. It was every man for himself with a great deal of snatching and bickering over the loot, even among brothers."																															996	No	"The relative importance of war honors and wealth can be judged from the fact that bravery and war deeds, the usual requirements for chieftainship on the Plains, though important, were here not essential. There were many chiefs who had never been on the warpath but who had achieved their position by their kindness, generosity, good judgement and wealth. 178178 A favored son was not expected to go on the warpath but often became a chief.Even a coward, “kopum”, one who feared the warpath, could become a chief, provided he had accumulated sufficient wealth to attract followers. By giving frequent feasts, spreading gifts judiciously and buying into the beaver and medicine-pipe societies, any man could gain considerable prestige."																															997	No	"A chief must be kind-hearted and open-handed, ever ready to share his food supply with the poorest of his tribe. His tipi must always welcome the stranger, and it devolved upon him to entertain generously the visiting chiefs and delegations from other tribes. One can readily see that such responsibilities required a family organisation that was not possible to the Blackfeet, excepting through polygamy."																															998	No	"Band and tribal leadership was not inherited but open to all who could command a following. A band headman gained a position of influence by displaying the qualities (see below) valued in his society and by his continued exercise of these attributes. His influence depended upon his power to persuade others, and the support of many followers increased this ability. He conferred with family heads and all decisions were reached by mutual agreement."																															999	No	"A man of ability, achievement, and with supernatural support was able to attract followers in his ventures of war and raiding, or in his political maneuvers. Influence began to build as he used these qualities and property to rally members of his family and band. He drew first upon the ties of kinship and then attracted followers from other groups to gain leadership within the band. The maintenance of this position, and the advance to higher status depended upon his ability to exercise all of his personal attributes in correct ways."																															1000	No	"People measured each other and themselves by the ideals, and in a society where gossip was an important control over behavior, verbal praise was eagerly sought. What people said about you was important, and the amount of praise a person received could be increased if he spoke well of himself. This seemed to be a response among the Blackfeet. People talked about their good deeds as well as the good and bad deeds of others, and were much concerned about their own good name. Men who aspired to leadership tested each other’s claims; while rising on their own claims they could climb faster, in a relative sense, if by gossip they could cut down the man above them."																															1001	No	"Indian-Oriented High Status The joint requirements of maintaining Indian identity and achieving this within the political and economic framework of white culture have opened two channels to prestige and leadership within the Indian-oriented group. The ideal leader in this situation would be a man wise in the ways of both traditional Blackfeet and modern American cultures. He would be an authority on how best to be an Indian, yet well educated, skilled, and able to meet the white man on common ground. He would be experienced sufficiently to gain acceptance and influence in white society and to act as an able interpreter of each group to the other. The history of Blackfeet and American relations is too short to have produced such an ideal in one man. Instead, as more and more tribal members become white-oriented, some men gain high status by their greater knowledge of Blackfeet culture as it is known today. These leaders form a least acculturated high status stratum that for the sake of simplicity, will be called the chiefs. Others, better educated and more experienced with white culture, find high status by playing the roles of intercultural interpreters and mediators. They are accomplished spokesmen for the Indian-oriented point of view, and as a more acculturated high status class are labeled interpreters. There are more than generational differences between these two status types."																															1002	No	"	Leaders of the party are appointed by the chief, usually men of affluence and commonly his relatives. There may be four or five leaders of a single large party. The qualities expected of them are bravery, ability to maintain their good sense in the excitement, and to go without sleep. Chiefs became such largely by the prestige of successful leadership in battle.	"																															1003	No	"A chief is one who has acquired his position in war, with some background of spirit experiences, wealth, ability to talk, and a suggestion of hereditary interest; this beyond natural ability for leadership. As one informant summed up his qualifications: he must be brave and have property; he must have presence to meet and talk with anyone, must be competent to arrange matters without dispute, and must have the interest of all his people at heart. I have described above how one leader sought power to lead a party to war. Since power is implicit for undertaking all things difficult, it must be assumed to be part of every chief’s make-up."																															1004	No	"Chiefs are wealthy. All informants gave the same term, l[unknown]o’[unknown]ki, for rich man and chief, and when asked for the rich men named the chiefs. They own many slaves; other people may have slaves, but many have none. Some chiefs have a number of wives. LEle’ks had seven at one time, not slaves, but one a Modoc, the others native. This, the largest marrige group known, argues considerable wealth. LEle’ks was accustomed to make frequent trips to northern tribes with captives to exchange for horses. Everything points to the rise in wealth of these men as dating only from the comparatively recent period of contact with the northern tribes. Up to that time at least shamans rivaled chiefs in wealth."																															1005	No	"Under the circumstances there can hardly be inheritance of chieftainship, largely because it is not an office to be regulated by definite succession. A chief’s relative may be chosen as war leader, but not of necessity. Since wealth figures, it may be that at least the possibility of succession is heritable, but a man who is personally disqualified will not be considered. Pat Kane’s paternal grandfather was a chief at du’kwa; further vision experiences had made him a good gambler but no shaman. But his son did not succeed because he was not competent and, in addition poor, nor has Pat any pretensions. On the death of LEle’ks, his son Solomon was passed over as lacking caliber, and in reservation days Alan David, previously a minor figure, was recognized in his place. Their relationship is unknown. My informants did not know whether the fathers of any of the chiefs named above had been chiefs before them."																															1006	No	"The emphasis among the chiefly functions is clearly on leadership in war and haranguing the people. Every morning before daylight he addresses them and again in the evening until the sun is well down. I am somewhat dubious that this procedure is as standardized as my informant had it. The address runs on fighting and acquiring spirit aid. He warns against hostile raiders; tells them to rise before daybreak; tells the young people to seek visions. “If you get a spirit, you cannot be killed; you will never fall sick; you will live to be old.” But he has no word as to where they shall hunt or fish or carry on other routine activities."																															1007	No	"A chief is not looked to to preserve peace. Old men may interfere in quarrels, but these are no especial concern of a chief. Nevertheless the word of an influential chief might end a feud. Just prior to reservation days the practice was introduced of tieing up and lashing quarrelsome men at the word of a chief. This was brought from the north by the cousin of my informant Nancy. It has a decided un-aboriginal flavor. A chief is under no obligation to help his people pay blood money, nor to assist them when starving. These are matters for relatives alone; they may die for all he is concerned."																															1008	No	"The number of plural wives depends on wealth; hence chiefs have more than others. From my notes I glean two instances of two wives, another of three. The wives in both bigamous cases were sisters. The greatest number known was the case of the chief LEle’ks, who had at one time seven wives, two of them sisters. 72Gatschet states ten, but I am certain there were not more than seven, at least at one time (2:126).I have described their derivations above. These women bore him many children. Whether the wives are sisters is a matter of complete indifference. To have two wives is called la’bwewa’nsg[unknown]itkt (lit., two females), three Enda’nwewa’nsg[unknown]itkt, and so on. Collectively the wives may be referred to as s[unknown]ipkska’ltk; they call each other p’tc[unknown]i[unknown]ki’p. Plural wives are paid for, but whether there is reciprocal visiting I do not know. Slaves are also taken to wife. Polyandry is unthinkable to the Klamath; it would be adulterous."																															1009	No	"The shaman himself is, or was, the outstanding figure of Klamath society. He had no rival in the chiefs, the rich man, until the coming of the whites brought a redistribution of emphasis in Klamath life. Chiefs had previously been persons of little influence.It is clear that the shaman is the most important individual in Klamath society, taking precedence over rich men, the chiefs. Shamans’ houses are the largest in the village and they have at least as much property as wealthy laymen. Invariably my informants spoke first of shamans in describing outstanding individuals. Their behavior and practices were readily formulated, whereas I experienced considerable difficulty in learning the functions and even the names of chiefs. It is reasonably certain that the status of the chiefs, that is the rich men, was relatively unimportant until the introduction of horses in the middle of the last century stimulated trading with the Columbia river tribes and perhaps brought in some of the northern view of the importance of wealth and chieftaincy. There is no doubt that the position of chiefs was strengthened by the habit of the whites of dealing with chiefs and other prominent laymen."																															1010	No	"Even now social stratification is only weakly developed. Chiefs were only recently set off from the mass, their functions vague and their influence slight. At the very moment that Klamath society began to break down with the coming of the whites, they first imported from the Columbia river judicial functions for the chiefs. Chiefs are the wealthiest individuals, but they are not chiefs because they are wealthy. Their selection is still based on principles of personal ability. The basis of this differentiation, wealth, came from the same direction, but the accompanying principle of the Northwest Coast, caste stratification, never reached here; nor did the chief’s adjunct, a speaker or advocate, although this functionary is known in the Plateau and Basin as well as in the Northwest."																															1011	No	"The rise of the chiefs helped to knit together tribal loyalties. A war party formerly consisted of only those among the able-bodied men who were inclined to fighting, but a successful leader increasingly transcended tribelet parochialism, drawing followers from diverse hamlets and villages across the Klamath country. As warfare became a way of life, the occasional allegiance rendered while in the field became an enduring acknowledgment of worth."																															1012	No	"Among the Pawnees, as in most horse-owning tribal cultures, an individual’s rank determined the number of horses owned. Although horses could be acquired as a gift and by natural increase in the herd, many horses were gained by raiding. Only chiefs and leading warriors could organize expeditions for this purpose. Therefore, the opportunities for their acquiring horses were far greater than were those of men of lesser rank. In addition, such leaders were given horses by younger men who were learning the craft when they accompanied such leaders on raiding expeditions and were successful themselves in capturing horses."																															1013	No	It has been mentioned that the Pawnee chiefs had the principal role in accepting or resisting the new concepts and items of “civilization” brought to their people. Some description of their traditional place in the society needs to be made here.																															1014	No	"The chiefs concurred when the hunt priest decided the day for starting the tribal hunt. They chose the Lance or Warrior Society that had the responsibility of scouting and guarding the people on the hunt. The leading Lance Society’s members were chiefs and male relatives. The chief had to give permission for war party formation and departure, and they selected the village heralds. They had seats in all sacred societies and their influence and control permeated all aspects of Pawnee life."																															1015	No	"The eldest son of a chief theoretically inherited his father’s position, and if he proved worthy was duly made chief on reaching the proper age. At this time the chief’s bundle (North-Star bundle) was opened and a ceremony held. So far as known, the ritual accompanying the ceremony has not been sung for more than thirty years, and there is no Skidi living today (1907) who knows it.It has been mentioned that the hereditary chiefs could invite men who had proved themselves worthy and make them chiefs. When this course was decided upon, the chiefs invited the one selected to the lodge four times. He declined the first three times, but on the fourth invitation went to the lodge, bringing with him ponies and parfleches of meat, which he presented to the chiefs. He was then made chief, but did not have his face painted, and his sons were not considered chiefs."																															1016	No	Perhaps the most important characteristic of a chief was that he was a peace-maker and guardian of the village rather than a warrior; there are many incidents in the myths expressing the idea that a man who has often been on the warpath becomes imbued with [Page 113] the desire to take scalps and capture ponies and is no longer fit to be chief.																															1017	No	"Their government was semi-republican. They were ruled by a head chief, in later times always the head chief of the Chau-i band; and this title was hereditary, but the chief, if he had not the requisite strength of character, might lose all his influence, and his position be practically, though not in name, held by a sub-chief or even warrior of his own or another band. As has been well said, “The office itself was hereditary, but authority could be gained only by acknowledged personal accomplishments.” Each band was ruled as to its own affairs by four chiefs—a head chief, second chief, third and fourth chiefs—but often some warrior who held no office, and bore no title, might wield more power and influence than any of these. In minor matters, the chief gave his orders without consultation with any one, but more important affairs were usually discussed in council by chiefs, head men and warriors, and the opinion of the assemblage prevailed, even if it were opposed to the opinion of the chief. Among the Pawnees, as elsewhere, a man’s personal character [Page 261] determined the position he should occupy and the influence he should wield. Bravery, wisdom, and personal popularity were the important factors in acquiring and retaining influence and authority."																															1018	No	"p of the band villages; it flowed more directly from the gradual introduction of individualized property control. The traditional native view of a chief was that he was the “father” of his people, who must see to the well-being of every individual in the tribe. To do so the chief had to be able to control a larger quantity of property than the average individual in order to give and help wherever it was necessary. This he accomplished through his individual prowess on the war path and the hunt. But in addition, tribespeople who valued him as chief and leader contributed to his resources in order to aid him to maintain himself and succor his people. Individual ownership of homes and farms not only made individuals materially independent of the chief and tribe, but reduced the chief to a property equality with his tribespeople, making it impossible for him to continue the customs of paternal generosity which tradition commended to him. Without being able to give to and help the poor and distraught, the chief not only lost respect and self-respect, but he was unable to prove his supernatural right to leadership, or that fortune was with him, that the powers of the universe were on his side, and through him were guiding the people."																															1019	No	"The chiefs had certain rituals of their own, such as the admittance of a new chief into their ranks. But the primary function of the council was the regulation of the semi-annual tribal buffalo hunt—to plan its schedule and arrange its coordination. In this, as in other political matters, a chief was a regulator, not an absolute ruler or tyrant. Although chiefs had considerable authority, their decisions were generally based on a consensus of opinion rather than arbitrary whim. The chief, like his celestial forebear, was supposed to be a guardian of the people, always mindful of their wishes and needs. And even though the office was hereditary in certain families, the man chosen to fill it had to demonstrate humility, generosity, and sagacity, because a jealous or aggressive temperament was considered unbefitting a chief."																															1020	No	"Pawnee society, no matter the band, was socially stratified. The preceding discussion of offices and organizations encompasses most of the recognized positions of status, although there were several others. First, however, it is important to understand a basic distinction made by the Pawnee themselves: People belonged to one of two groups, the upper classes or the commoners. The dichotomy was in part determined by hereditary rights, for the members of the leading families (the chiefs and their assistants, the priests, and often the doctors) inherited their positions. Other people had no such advantage: They could raise their position through their own efforts, by achieving success in war, by joining the men’s societies, or possibly by becoming a doctor; but otherwise they remained among the insignificant. Thus class distinction was one of privilege—access to positions of leadership, special knowledge, and titles."																															1022	No	"Although the chieftainship was hereditary in certain families, the individuals selected to fill the post were chosen for their humility and sagacity. An aggressive temperament was considered a barrier to the office. There were definite implicit mechanisms for village coordination and interband cooperation, often by means of emissaries sent between the households of chiefs to express their combined opinions and to learn the wishes of the other parties. Public opinion and consensus were always well estimated. No official conceived that an arbitrary decision was feasible or desirable."																															1023	No	"One of the duties of the warrior chief was to enforce moral behavior. He went “from house to house” giving warning to those suspected of anti-social conduct which might offend the supernaturals. When his warnings went unheeded, he boxed the offender's ears. Public ridicule is said not to have been used as a disciplinary technique."																															1024	No	"The word in Hopi, for a leader of any kind, is moñ'wi (pl. moñ'mowitû). Thus, the stem ma'k- means ‘to hunt’: hence ma'k moñ'wi, ‘hunt leader’, referring to the man who organises and directs a communal (rabbit) hunt. Yet the matter is not quite as simple as that, for the man who directs a communal hunt is responsible for carrying out the ritual on which the success of the hunt depends. And this brings us, at a step, to one of the key facts of Hopi life, namely: no leadership among the Hopi is without its ritual responsibilities, and conversely, all authority has a religious tap-root. As Titiev puts it: 2 ‘the sacred and the civil are inextricably commingled in the political structure …’"																															1025	No	"It is evident, from the words used by the Kwan head at his induction, that Hopi regard the Village chief primarily as intermediary between themselves and the Cloud People. He is responsible, at Oraibi, for carrying through the Soyal on which the welfare of the pueblo depends. Grouped with him in this enterprise are the other Soyal officers, known (like him) as moñ'mowitû, ‘chiefs’, and bearing (as he does) the outward signs of ‘chiefship’, namely the chief's stick ( moñ'kohü) and the special clay markings on face, shoulders and leg which—only adopted on special ritual occasions—distinguish them from ordinary people. 33 These insignia pertain to all the Soyal officers, except the War chief: and also to the leaders of the Al (Horn), Kwan (Agave) and Tao (Singers) fraternities, who are likewise known as ‘chiefs’.As the leader of this group, the Village chief has special responsibility for maintaining harmony within the village; and it is in this context, as ‘chief of the houses’, that he wields a measure of political authority. Primarily, this authority is expressed in the settlement of land disputes, either in adjudicating between two claimants to a given piece of land, or in awarding damages for destruction of crops by livestock. Beyond this, his opinion may be sought on any issue affecting the village as a whole; but no compulsion is brought to bear to force people to take their disputes to the Village chief, and even in the old days, such decisions as he gave he lacked the power to enforce."																															1026	No	"Leaders were not the “charismatic leaders” that one expects to find leading social movements in the sense that Max Weber (1949:329) used the term. The charismatic leader is “set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities.” “By using the words ‘charisma’ (the gift of grace), Weber emphasizes the inspirational, revelatory nature of this kind of authority. The followers of the charismatic leader show ‘complete personal devotion’ to him. His authority is based on a ‘sign or proof, originally a miracle’” (Worsley 1968:278–81). Having no tradition of charisma or individualistic shamanism, Hopis ideally value just the opposite characteristics in persons, that is, persons who are pas i unangwaitaqua — meek, of pure heart, well behaved, modest. Some one who was “charismatic” would be labelled ka-hopi, bad or, kwiivi, a snobbish braggart, a know-it-all, or pas himuniqai naami wuuwantaqa: one who thinks himself going to be something; conceited, a big shot (Brandt 1954:125–136). The more the Movement's leaders gravitated toward charisma, the more critical Hopis became of them (Geertz 1987b); the more well-known they became outside Hopiland, the more they were pushed by Euro-American cultural patterns to assume charismatic roles (cf. Elston 1988:49)."																															1027	No	"Within the village there are certain extensions of kinship of a symbolic sort. The village chief is considered as a “father” and may be so addressed on ritual occasions, and corresponding terms are employed for members of his immediate family such as his sisters and his wife. Likewise important medicine men or priests may be referred to as “fathers.”"																															1028	No	"While the village chief in theory controls the land and the village, he should not participate directly in disputes or quarrels, since such activities are thought to have a deleterious effect on village welfare. Problems should be settled by other chiefs or by clan heads, if possible; only as a last resort should they be taken to the village chief unless they were directly concerned with land."																															1029	No	"The only chief with “police” functions was the War Chief, but he does not have the same authority that his counterparts at Zuni and other Pueblos possess. At Oraibi in recent times the War Chief was a Soyal officer, but in earlier days he was head of the War society and a member of the Coyote-Masau'u-Kokop clan group. 156156. Around 1900 the Soyal War Chief was a member of the Real Badger clan.Go to end note pageHe had the duty of maintaining order and discipline, but he had no punitive powers other than those connected with his war leadership."																															1030	No	"Bradfield's argument that Orayvi's population was growing at the same time the quality of the land was deteriorating has been questioned by Whiteley (1988:247–51), who raises several objections: (1) that leadership was based on control over ritual knowledge and not over land, “the ‘supposed’ economic ground of their leadership was thus not susceptible to undermining”; (2) that there were many alternative lands available, especially at Munqapi, “which was increasingly absorbing elements of Oraibi's population,” and that these areas comprised “readily available alternatives that were in fact being used”; and (3) that [Page 107] the availability of wage work and access to commodities at the Orayvi store “provided palpable supplements to the subsistence economy by the late 1890s.”"																															1031	No	"The Hopi village chief, however, does not lack authority nor fail to command the respect of his people. The chief of Oraibi was relieved of the burden of cultivating his own fields by his villagers (Titiev, 1944:65). In theory, no village-wide action should be initiated without his approval. If the people accuse each other of negligence in religious duties and of indulging in social dances and debauchery, the chief must remain detached from such unruly subjects and concentrate on prayers and rituals. He is their “father” and they his “children.” Like a Hopi father, he is indulgent and seldom reprimands his people. Hopi folktales frequently describe the distress of a chief because of the misdemeanors of his people. Even if a chief rebukes the people, he does through his personal sacrifice, revealing to them how “sad” he is. The chief avoids involvement and partiality by seldom making his will explicit."																															1033	No	"About two miles to the southeast of Oraibi, off the mesa, there was a valley of rich, fertile soil. The Oraibi Wash that ran through this valley drained a watershed extending some sixty miles north into the Black Mountains. This land was set aside for the use of the Chief and eight or ten head men of the village. The Chief had about ten acres nearest the wash, and the others [Page 39] were alloted favorable areas, according to their rank."																															1034	No	"ents. Theoretically, the chief owned all the land pertaining to his village, and men worked it only at his pleasure. Here then is the sting behind the chief's decrees. If people disobeyed or displeased him, the chief could, at least in theory, deprive them of land or assign them to distant or unfavorable plots. Actually, he very rarely ousted owners from traditionally held farms, as there are several instances of men who had continued to cultivate good land in defiance of the chief's wishes. Whether or not the threat worked, the chief's right to withdraw land provided a theoretical club for enforcing his commands."																															1035	No	"“The status of the old leaders in the eyes of their fellow-clansmen is greatly enhanced if they have been kutu[unknown] ula to other totemic groups. Attention may be drawn to the fact that a local clan, if its members are too small to permit of an efficient staging of the ceremonies which are in its possession, may call proved men from neighbouring places to its assistance.

They, with other braves and elders, worked out a secret plan of the war strategy, planning the initial attack, deployment of the manpower during the offensive and later on the battle lines, they authorized and often led individual raids into the enemy territory by day or night. If need be, they organized defense of their confederacy’s villages by erecting fortifications of plank fences. In the deployment of their fighting forces they manipulated individual lineages in a similar way as our generals do army divisions. They assigned them their roles in the attack and later their positions on the battle lines.On the [Page 118] battle lines they were true leaders, shouting orders and expecting immediate compliance. Warriors disobeying their orders were publicly reprimanded after the battle and put to shame.

As a result of these attitudes and of the fact that a debtor may be punished by withdrawing credit at any time, debtors are the most reliable followers a native headman may have. They support him in legal disputes as well as in wars, offer him services, and are vitally interested in his prosperity and health. The creditor’s prosperity makes it highly probable that the debt will not have to be repaid [Page 32] in the near future. Also, the creditor’s health and life are important to the debtors because, in case he dies, the creditor’s heir would invariably ask for immediate repayment of their debts."																															1039	No	"The behavior of members of a sublineage (or of a non-subdivided lineage) discloses mutual affection and a strong sense of belonging and unity. Within this group all fighting is considered deplorable. Even an organized stick fight, which occasionally disrupts the otherwise cordial relations within a lineage, is unheard of in this subgroup. The main responsibility of the leader of the sublineage is to prevent or to quell an occasional brawl and to mete out a deserved punishment in accord with customary law."																															1040	No	"Political faction . Any of the segments of the Kapauku society which are politically organized (confederacy, lineage, sublineage) may have more than one headman. Usually these leaders cooperate in administering justice and in solving internal as well as external political problems. However, because personalities are sometimes incompatible, rivalry between some co-leaders may split any of the groups into two hostile camps. As a consequence, in settling disputes between the members of these opposite camps the people may resort to stick fights sponsored by the two competing headmen. The situation becomes serious, especially when the leading rivals live in the same village. In such a case the inhabitants of the same community form two semihostile groups of a new type. Each leader of such a group decides cases among his followers and tries to compete with his rival in adjudicating disputes on the village level. As these groups have no functions other than the political and legal, they may be called “political factions.”"																															1041	No	"Early during my research it became obvious that the impression of leaderless and lawless society originated in a misunderstanding of the native egalitarian philosophy [Page 45] and of the fact that among Kapauku Papuans social conformity is achieved by inducement rather than by compulsion. These people do punish offenders for their crimes, but they never force them to conform. Individual freedom is highly valued, and it is never taken away from anyone, not even from a criminal. Institutions such as jail and home prison, or captivity, serfdom, or slavery are unheard of. Since Kapauku culture is generally oriented toward economic activity, and status is mostly derived from individual wealth, the most frequent types of political and legal inducements take the form of monetary sanction, or withdrawal or extension of credit. The decisions of native authorities are informally rendered. If one insists upon compulsion and formality, then the presence of leadership in most Kapauku groups does appear to be illusory until an analysis of greater depth is made. Only the politically unorganized, traditional, consanguineal kinship groups lack authority."																															1042	No	"The leadership in the native household is formally defined by coinciding with ownership of the house. Similarly, authority in polygynous and nuclear families is formally determined on the basis of kin and marital bonds (father, husband). On the contrary, such clear-cut formal criteria of authority are absent in the rest of the Kapauku groups. In all of these groups the leadership rests on wealthy, informal headmen of limited power whom the natives call tonowi . The headman’s status is defined by two sets of criteria of different order: his personal criteria refer to the headman as an individual; his societal criteria determine his status in the society according to his membership in the particular subgroups of the society. The former criteria determine an individual as a leader; the latter designate his rank in the hierarchy of headmen."																															1043	No	"The personal criteria of a Kapauku headman are listed below. The first three should be considered basic, in the sense that no individual can become a leader among these natives unless he possesses all of them. The last three may be regarded as nonessential but power-enhancing.1. Wealth. The Kapauku are profit-motivated, economically minded, and place high value on personal wealth, from which they derive their greatest prestige. Consequently it should not be surprising that wealth is a prerequisite for attaining political leadership. The importance of wealth in the political field becomes even more obvious when we realize that the extension of credit constitutes the primary avenue for social control. People usually follow decisions of a wealthy man because they are his debtors and are afraid of being asked to return what they owe, or out of gratitude for past financial aid, or because they expect future financial favors. To comply with the requests and decisions of a wealthy man means economic security. Since wealth depends on successful pig breeding as well as upon age, the political structure of the group is in constant flux. New individuals succeed to leadership only to lose their position some years later to younger and more successful pig breeders.2. Generosity. Hoarding wealth does not of itself carry prestige and fails to attract followers. It is the distribution of wealth and the extension of credit that [Page 46] perform these functions. A wealthy creditor not only becomes a political leader and legal authority, but he is also regarded as among the most moral of individuals.3. Eloquence and verbal courage. In the village of Botukebo lives Ijaaj Timai-jokainaago who is known for his wealth and generosity. However, he failed to attain leadership because of his gentle and shy personality. In spite of his wealth and generosity, a man who is afraid to argue in public and pass judgment has hardly a chance of becoming a headman.4. Physical fitness. Since lack of health and old age preclude economic success and accumulation and retention of wealth, a native headman as a rule is healthy and middle-aged. As he grows older his wealth dissipates and his role as a political leader fades away.5. Bravery. Leadership in war requires personal bravery. Although nonessential to political leadership, bravery enhances the prestige and power of the native headman.6. Shamanism. The reputation of possessing supernatural, shamanistic power provides a headman with additional means of social control. Like bravery, it is not a necessary attribute for the assumption of leadership."																															1044	No	"A headman’s societal status (as distinct from his social status as a headman) is defined by his membership in the particular subgroups of the society and by the web of the mutual relations of these subgroups with the rest of the society’s segments. The societal status not only designates his rank in the hierarchy of the various types of headmen, but also determines the amount of his power, the scope of his jurisdiction, and the type of law he is supposed to administer.Several generalizations can be made with respect to the societal status of a tonowi .1. Every functioning subgroup (societal segment) has a leader.		2. His rank depends on the inclusiveness of the group of which he is a leader. Accordingly, for example, the headman of a confederacy is superior to the headman of a lineage.3. In order to assume a higher status as headman of a more inclusive group one must already be the headman of one of the constituent subgroups. Thus political statuses are cumulative. The tonowi of a political confederacy retains his position as tonowi of his lineage and sublineage, as well as leader of his household. His followers, his power, and the content of law he administers differ in every instance. This point can be well demonstrated by the actual hierarchy of political leadership within the Ijaaj-Pigome Confederacy (see Fig. 4). Accordingly Ekajewaijokaipouga, for example, holds leadership positions for the whole Ijaaj-Pigome Confederacy, of the Ijaaj-Gepouja lineage, and of the Ijaaj-Jamaina sublineage, and is also the head of the largest household in the village of Aigii.4. The most populous of those groups, which together form a group on the higher level of inclusiveness, provides authority for this higher group, as evidenced by the leader of the Ijaaj-Pigome Confederacy who comes from its most numerous constituent subgroup—the Ijaaj-Gepouja lineage. Because his own Ijaaj-Jamaina sublineage is stronger than the Ijaaj-Enona sublineage of the headman of Botukebo he, rather than his competitor, is destined to be the headman of the lineage, despite the fact that his village, Aigii, is smaller than that of his rival. Within his sublineage the headman of the confederary happens to reside in the largest village, possessing there the largest household (see Fig. 3).5. If in a group there are several rich people who qualify by their personal (social) criteria for headmanship, all of them share jurisdiction equally. However, only the wealthiest represents the unit in disputes with outsiders. Thus in the absence of a societal criterion (membership in different subgroups), the personal criterion of relative wealth determines the outside representation of a group which has several headmen of equal rank."																															1045	No	"Status of the buyer . A man who is rich and a political leader is often offered commodities for prices lower than normal, either because the seller expects future favors from the tonowi, or because he is afraid the rich man might ask payment of a debt the seller owes him. Accordingly, Ijaaj Jokagaibo, the headman of Aigii, and Ijaaj Ekajewaijokaipouga, the headman of the whole Ijaaj-Pigome Confederacy, were able to buy several pigs from people of their own constituencies, and even from outsiders, at less than market prices."																															1046	No	"As with every Kapauku individual, the headman also finds important support among his imee bagee, “the kinsmen.” These individuals are induced to follow their rich relative because of an emotional bond as well as because of a network of duties, rights, and expectations of future reciprocal favors. It is always good for a Kapauku to have a headman as a close relative because one can depend upon his help in economic, political, and legal matters. The other followers of a tonowi recognize him as a leader and accept his decisions as binding either out of gratitude for his past generosity or because they expect future favors and economic advantages."																															1047	No	"When both sides are tired of warfare, and when there is an equal number of dead on both sides, it is time to start peace negotiations. The quasi-groups of in-law relatives of the confederacy headmen are usually employed for this purpose. These men function as go-betweens who arrange the conditions for an armistice. After this is accomplished, peace is formally concluded at a pig feast when the former enemies dance together in front of the dance house. The gathered multitude is then addressed from the roof of the structure by its leaders, [Page 61] who declare cessation of hostilities and urge their followers to live again in peace."																															1048	No	"Since freedom of movement and of premeditated action is regarded as a basic condition of life it would be highly incongruous if in such conditions one encountered the same enforcement of laws and decisions that we in the West are accustomed to. Consequently the native authorities do not compel their followers by force or threat of force to comply with their decisions. They try to persuade them through oratory, or by threats of withdrawing credit or not granting future monetary, legal, or political support. In this way they preserve the people’s personal independence. A follower always has a choice—either to comply with the decision of his headman and receive monetary advantages and political and legal favors, or to disregard his leader’s wishes at the price of antagonizing him and being denied various favors. Thus a Kapauku is independent in the sense that all his actions follow his own decisions rather than someone else’s. The concept of physical force, or the threat of it, is certainly not essential for the existence of legal control. The important thing is that the legal decisions are properly made and obeyed. The mechanism that induces such compliance differs from one society to another."																															1049	No	"“Botabalu lives in a high-chief's house, and has women and girls for her companions, who keep the house clean and tidy. Whenever there is excreta to be thrown away, a special present is paid to her companions. She is a stout woman. and does not walk about. Most of her time is spent in the village, and because she is a great chieftainess, with many kinsmen and numerous villages under her rule, she is greatly feared by all."																															1050	No	"Chieftainship, which is hereditary, the elder-sister's son usually being the heirapparent, was maintained by several important underlying factors. The most prominent was polygamy whereby the chief accumulated large stores of food, and so was in a position to give great feasts, to pay for work done on his behalf, and last but not least his many storehouses in which food was displayed added to his prestige in a land where rank was associated with food and the quantity of it owned by a man.Again polygamy gave the chief a direct connection with the villages from which his wives were drawn, and so a more or less temporary confederacy of villages helped the chief in his control over a district, and according to the power and authority of a chief, so the villagers of his district listened to his orders and his desires.The chief, by virtue of his wealth in food, also obtained a controlling interest in other native wealth, and as in pre-governmental days he was one of the few who owned pigs, betel nuts, and coconuts, his subjects were dependent on his and his relations' generosity for these luxuries."																															1051	No	"As the chief was the richest man in the community, he had the command of sorcerers, for he could pay more to a sorcerer for services rendered than anyone else. Again, after he had been in the position as a chief for some time, he would also receive acknowledgment from his people that he possessed a knowledge of the black arts, and no doubt from time to time took credit for deaths that had occurred quite naturally. The fear of sorcery among the people being deeply rooted, they usually came to fear their chief, but at the same time they held him in esteem for his many good qualities, and also for the beneficent magical powers he was supposed to command."																															1052	No	"Prior to the introduction of iron, the people used stone axes, but it is very doubtful if there were sufficient to go round, so that the chief found no difficulty in getting commoners connected by marriage to [Page 21] make gardens for him. Possibly, too, part of the garden routine came into being owing to the lack of sufficient gardening tools. The introduction of iron gave an added independence to the commoners."																															1053	No	"The first plots on the way out of the village usually belong to the chief, his kinsmen or an esteemed gardener; 35 they are called the “standard plots” ( leywota ). They serve as examples of the standard of gardening required and are the pride of the village. As such they are meticulously worked and receive the fullest magical treatment of all the garden plots. 36 Each new phase of garden work is always begun on the standard plots, and until work is completed on them no succeeding stage may be inaugurated. The progress of work on the other plots must correspond with the stage of gardening evident on the standard plots. 37"																															1054	No	"Affines must annually render return gifts for urigubu (matrimonial harvest gifts) received: a man's sister provides his wife with “women's wealth”, and the man presents “men's wealth” to the wife's brother. By virtue of polygyny, 96numerous affines provide a chief with tribute in the form of urigubu , thus enhancing his power. 97A chief may call on affines for purposes of peacekeeping in war. 98Should such duties of affines as pertain to mortuary ceremonial, urigubu or war be evaded, the political implications are that relations between the individuals' sub-clans, and hence their respective villages, would become severely strained"																															1055	No	"Men attain particular significance in political life by their position in the kula , 121and by the fact that they alone may aspire to roles of leadership. 1"																															1056	No	"Political leadership in the Trobriand Islands has been a matter of particular interest because it was unusual for Melanesia. It is clear that Trobriand society was egalitarian in comparison to stratified societies in many parts of the world and therefore that Trobriand chiefs were chiefs in a strictly limited sense. However, the political system was distinct from the ‘big-man’ system in that a local Trobriand subclan or dala had only one recognised leader, not any number. Further, the many subclans and their respective leaders had different ascribed ranks (Brunton 1975:544)."																															1057	No	"It is clear that centrality and ecology affect dala status. It has been found within districts; that the most central villages were the places where the highest-ranking individuals were found. It is not difficult to suggest why this should be. Chiefs managed unusually large quantities of resources and it is agreed that the basis of such wealth was polygamy. Rank was quite directly expressed in the number of wives. The chief of Omarakana had 16 wives in Malinowski's time, while his predecessor Enamakala had 19 in 1893 (Annual Report 1893-4:19). In 1950 despite long-established missionary activity, there were still 13 (Powell 1960: 136). In traditional Trobriand society it seems that all leaders of village clusters of guyau status became polygamists. An emerging leader might also expect to be given wives by traditional allies outside the cluster while he might demand them from traditional rivals of subordinate subclans (Powell 1960:136), Powell also claims (1960:136), giving some idea of scale, that in Kiriwina in ‘olden times’ the leader of Kwaybwaga cluster might have had about 9 wives while the leader of the Omarakana cluster might accumulate 40 in a successful political career."																															1058	No	"Under the system of urigubu (to oversimplify the case), the bulk of one's annual harvest went to fill the yam house of one's sister's husband. The basis of chiefly power was the increased quantity of such tribute (Powell 1960:134), for while most people's income and outgoings were about the same, polygamists received more than they gave away (Powell 1969:584). The respective ranks of giver and receiver affected the size of urigubu gifts. Values given by Powell (1969:583) and Malinowski (1935: Appendices II, III and IV) show that rank differentiation among Trobriand village and cluster leaders was reflected in very great variation in the number and size of the gifts they received. It is also clear that some leaders of high status commanded very considerable resources indeed. The receipt of multiple gifts was simultaneously a consequence and cause of a leader's pre-eminence (Powell 1969:591). The status of chiefs lay not [Page 48] only in the resources at their command, but under this system, potential political rivals were deprived of the opportunity to accumulate comparable quantities of the resources."																															1059	No	"This section will not review the anthropological controversy over how to classify and explain the traditional Trobriand system of political leadership. 1 In this paper, the Kiriwina category guyau is simply translated as ‘chief’. A ‘chief’ is a village headman who is also the holder of upper-level status in the ascribed social ranking system which divides all Trobrianders into two categories, privileged and commoner. The status of such a privileged headman is marked by such attributes as house and yamhouse decoration, special personal adornment, rights to ritual deference from others, polygyny, and rights to certain kinds of tribute. Such headmen, whether privileged or not, are the primary organizers of large scale collective activities. This means kula journeys, harvest festivities, cricket matches, and in most cases the village gardening cycle. Formerly they were also the organizers of warfare."																															1060	No	"Such headmen, especially the privileged ones, compete vigorously against each other for renown. The privileged headmen or chiefs are loosely inter-graded amongst themselves in ascriptive prestige terms. This fluid scaled model of precedence is not rigid, however, because it is conceptually interlinked with and supplemented by a second model of leadership based on open achievement of renown and name-building through prowess in gardening and ceremonial exchange, wisdom in decisio-making and dispute-settlement, and skill in establishing alliances and political support. On these skeletal criteria there is a considerable number of chiefs in Trobriand society at any given point in time. Probably the range 10-25 would quantitatively cover the number of such positio-holders at any one moment over the last eighty years."																															1061	No	"One point in connection with the chief's authority deserves special mention. Power implies not only the possibility of rewarding, but also the means of punishing. This in the Trobriands is as a rule done indirectly, by means of sorcery. The chief has the best sorcerers of the district always at his beck and call. Of course he also has to reward them when they do him a service. If anyone offends him, or trespasses upon his authority, the chief summons the sorcerer, and orders that the culprit shall die by black magic. And here the chief is powerfully helped in achieving his end by the fact that he can do this openly, so that everybody, and the victim himself knows that a sorcerer is after him. As the natives are very deeply and genuinely afraid of sorcery, the feeling of being [Page 65] hunted, of imagining themselves doomed, is in itself enough to doom them in reality. Only in extreme cases, does a chief inflict direct punishment on a culprit. He has one or two hereditary henchmen, whose duty it is to kill the man who has so deeply offended him, that actual death is the only sufficient punishment. As a matter of fact, very few cases of this are on record, and it is now, of course, entirely in abeyance."																															1062	No	"Thus the chief's position can be grasped only through the realisation of the high importance of wealth, of the necessity of paying for everything, even for services which are due to him, and which could not be withheld. Again, this wealth comes to the chief from his relations-in-law, and it is through his right to practise polygamy that he actually achieves his position, and exercises his power."																															1063	No	"The chief's head must not be overtopped by anybody. When commoners are moving about, he must be seated on a high platform; if he stands, they must bend. When commoners have to pass a chief who happens to be seated, the chief has to rise -- an uncomfortable prerogative strictly adhered to in the Trobriands. If, for any reason, he remains seated or squatting, commoners have to creep on their bellies. I have myself witnessed all the people present in the village of Bwoytalu dropping from various elevations to the ground, as if mown down by a hurricane, at the sound of the long drawn O guya'u! announcing the arrival of one of my Omarakana friends who came to visit me in that village of low rank. In Omarakana also I have frequently seen people of low rank approaching the chief in a crouching position, dragging their hunting-spears behind them as was due and proper."																															1064	No	"Lokwa'i is perhaps the most important tree with edible leaves, but it is tabooed to the chiefs. Some of the others are allowed to everyone."																															1065	No	"Discounting retrospective optimism, I think we shall not be wide of the mark if we assess 20,000 to 25,000 baskets as the average amount of the chief's uriguba in olden days. We have only to remember that whereas at present (1918) the chief has twelve wives, in olden days he had from sixty to fourscore."																															1066	No	"It is a very remarkable fact in the constitution of the tribe of which we are speaking, that the source of power is principally economic, and that the chief is able to carry out many of his executive functions and to claim certain of his privileges only because he is the wealthiest man in the community. A chief is entitled to receive tokens of high respect, to command observance and require services; he can ensure the participation of his subjects in war, in any expedition and in any festival; but he needs to pay [Page [facing p. 131]]heavily for all these things. He has to give great feasts and finance all enterprises by feeding the participants and rewarding the chief actors. Power in the Trobriands is essentially plutocratic. And a no less remarkable and unexpected feature of this system of government is that, although the chief needs a large revenue, there is nothing of the sort directly attached to his office: no substantial tributes are paid him by the inhabitants as from subject to chief. The small annual offerings or tribute in special dainties--the first fish caught, vegetable primiti[unknown] , special nuts and fruits--are by no means a source of revenue; in fact the chief has to repay them at full value. For his real income he has to rely entirely on his annual marriage contribution. This, however, in his case, is very large, for he has many wives, and each of them is far more richly dowered than if she had married a commoner."																															1067	No	"Perhaps the best way shortly to describe indigenous Trobriand political organization is as a variant of the systems of competitive individual leadership by ‘Big Men’ common in adjacent parts of Melanesia, which is modified in the Trobriands, at least in Northern Kiriwina Island, by the system of rank. This restricts eligibility to compete for political leadership in any given locality to the members of the highest ranking matrilineal descent group or sub-clan ( dala ) associated with it, and at the same time tends to ensure that amongst them one man is always singled out as at least the potential leader of the locality. Upon him the population's economic and political relationships tend to focus so that it becomes organized as his following, and tends to co-operate as a unit in competition with similarly led and organized populations of other localities. Trobriand political activity thus consists in a continuing process of creation, expansion, and contraction of followings and areas of influence by men qualified to compete for leadership. The followings and areas of influence thus established are however coterminous with the careers of the leaders who create and maintain them. They do not crystallize into or become stabilized as permanent major chiefdoms or administrative hierarchies, but disintegrate when their creation lose support or die, so that their successors must in effect start again the whole process of building up followings for themselves. But as we shall see the attribute of rank confers on those who possess it certain advantages which provide them with the nucleus of a following as well as with the right to aspire to expand it at least to the extent commensurate with their rank."																															1068	No	"The term boda is widely used of any more or less organized body with a recognized leader, from children playing a team game to war parties, cricket teams, or political factions. The cluster leader, like the village headman, provides a focus for the internal organization of his following, initiates and organizes its co-operative enterprises, represents it in its relationships with other cluster populations, and as a result achieves considerable influence and power over its individual members."																															1069	No	"The pokala has other significances also; it is for instance the primary means of securing from one's seniors a personal inheritance in sub-clan property, and of ensuring that someone, e.g. a particular ‘sister's son’ ( kada ), will by inheriting such property assume the responsibility of conducting the mortuary rituals for his ‘mother's brother’ ( kada ), (cf. Malinowski 1929 chap. 6 sects. 2-4). For present purposes however the pakala is important as one means by which an ambitious young man can attract attention and build up his prestige among his contemporaries with the aim of being selected as the next leader or ‘headman’ ( tolivalu ) of his sub-clan and its village. If no ambitious young man emerges in this way, the senior men of a sub-clan will in time single out the likeliest successor to the current headman and require of him the same kinds of services and assistance that that an ambitious junior would render voluntarily. Not every young man wishes to be selected, perhaps the majority being content to render the acceptable minimum of gifts and services to their seniors; for the leadership of an average commoner sub-clan and its village tends to be more onerous than rewarding, involving as it does the assumption of increasingly heavy urigubu responsibilities without any commensurate increase in the marriage gifts received by the commoner village leader."																															1070	No	"The first public assertion and recognition of the new leader's position seems usually to consist in his organizing and conducting the mortuary rites for his predecessor, whose marriages are ceremonially terminated by these rites (Malinowski 1929, pp. 31-4, 130-39, and esp. 292). Informants said that in the case of so important a cluster leader as the Omarakana Tabalu every effort would be made to ensure that a successor was agreed upon as soon as possible after the accession of any given leader. Even so, the recognized future leader tended to try to eliminate possible rivals, especially by sorcery and poison."																															1071	No	"An important and effective sanction not explicitly dealt with by Malinowski is what may be termed deprivation of benefits of kin or local group membership. One of the responsibilities of the recognized sub-clan and village leader is to act as trustee for all the land, trees, magic and other forms of sub-clan property which is not held by individual members. It is in the leader's power to allocate rights of usufruct of such property to members of the sub-clan or residents in the village in response to formal requests by pokala ; and conversely he can withhold from those who do not accept his leadership any material advantages thus sought. Other senior men with personal holdings of land or other property can exercise the same sanction over their juniors, and the leader depends on their support for the efficacy of this sanction in his hands; for if they do not approve of his action in refusing they can themselves confer the advantages sought. The non-material as well as the material advantages of sub-clan or village membership can be withheld or conferred in this way. Thus a villager may be refused the support of other residents if he refuses to follow the advice of the leaders in a particular project or dispute, or a woman may be refused urigubu in respect of a proposed marriage which is not approved by her sub-clan's leader and other senior men.As has been indicated the main forces which sustain organized village leadership, in so far as this is necessary in the corporate life of the small groups concerned, are those which operate also in other aspects of social control; namely the pressures upon the individual to conform to the corporate interests and policies of his fellows. These pressures are derived from his close and immediate interdependence with his kin and affines, and these two categories include all his fellow villagers and many others besides."																															1072	No	"have given a brief description of the physical characters of the islanders elsewhere, 1 but it may be noted here that some chiefs are bigger men than the commoners. This was quite obvious at Kavatari, where Pulitari and his brother were noticeably taller than the other men seen in the village which I visited on two occasions."																															1073	No	"Each tribe has its chief ( somol ki), often even two or three. The chiefs, as a rule, are taken from the kin group which was the dominant one from the beginning and perhaps first settled on the land concerned. Thus, on Uman the Fesinim kin group rules; on Poloas, Immo; and on Fefan, Soufar. The Pue kin group rose in this island and occupies many a chief’s seat. Atau governs on Faituk, Sepelo on Udot, after Ipä[unknown]es perished in the wars, and Sapulupi on Wöla. In all there might be 400 to 500 chiefs. If one considers that the total population of the Truk lagoon hardly amounts to 12,000 people, the number of chiefs must be designated as unnaturally large. In spite of the fact that one such chief has a small area with few people under him, compactness and co-operation are missing. Although the chief proudly calls himself awen fanu, mouth of the land, lugen fanu, heart of the land, or säli[unknown]en fanu, ear of the land, he generally has little to say. Only some one or other understands how to keep his people together, because he knows how to gain influence as a result of previous warlike deeds or personal cunning and lack of consideration. In addition to this, several who live in his territory come from other tribes, pay tribute to their homeland chief, and do not concern themselves about him."																															1074	No	"The natives have many a trick so that the corruption will not come to light so openly. For example, if a common man wants help from the chief, or the latter from the head chief, he gives him abundant food and other things which please him, without, however, saying anything about his secret intention. He repeats this maneuver several times until he finds a favorable moment to come out with his request. This is not direct corruption, but it serves the same purpose. The chief is morally obliged to help, since on Truk bribery of the “stomach” is also bribery of the heart. That is, in the Truk language the word lug is used for stomach and heart."																															1075	No	"The main task of the chief is the laying down and execution of the bu[unknown]un fanu, that is, the tribal laws. In practice the bu[unknown] is usually illusory, since nobody wants to follow it. Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax."																															1076	No	"Upon the delivery of the head tax the chiefs were given a few marks back from the German government as gratification. All in all the chief’s office is not a position which can make the possessor rich. It is understandable if the chief further bleeds his people somewhat on the side, especially since often enough he must draw on his purse in their behalf. If two families quarrel on account of something and the one must pay compensation, it is advanced by the chief if the family cannot pay. If someone from a foreign tribe has a claim on a member of his tribe, the chief is responsible for it. All creditors depend on him. Afterwards he can see to getting it back from the debtors. It is strange that the chief is even obliged to distribute gifts here and there. If he sees that one of his people is stirred up about something and he fears disagreeable /118/ scenes, he calms him with little gifts. [Page 129] He knows from experience that the subjects are able to annoy the chief more than he them."																															1077	No	"The chief’s authority to punish no longer goes very far. Once master over life and death, now he can only order imprisonment or hard labor. The hard labor usually consists of pulling grass on public roads or carrying stones to canoe wharves. Nevertheless the people do not hurt themselves at this work and get out of it whenever they can. Instead of pulling grass, they sit smoking and talking on the road."																															1078	No	"When someone enters the chief’s house, it must be done bent over. The order for the aporo, fefeiro, to bow before the chief, holds for everybody, with the exception of his wife and his children. The subjects must also observe this rule in front of the wife of the chief and his sisters. Natives of lower standing may not eat the fish that such a fefin bokid (distinguished woman) has caught."																															1079	No	"The intercourse of the chiefs among themselves is sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, according to their interests. Tribes and chiefs favorably disposed toward each other reciprocally give gifts of fish, turtles, and fruits to each other. If one chief is sick, friends visit him with their people and bring small gifts as an expression of their sympathy. Such chiefs also help each other with heavy work and lend each other canoes and tools."																															1080	No	"One of the district’s lineages is the chiefly lineage. It is thought to be the first lineage to have entered the previously unsettled territory and it is considered the original owner of the entire district. Lineages that arrived later received grants of land from the original lineage and owe first fruits to its leader, the “district chief” ( samwoonun soopw). The chief is the highest ranking person of the district, and everyone should respect him. Conversely, he should be very humble and respectful towards those of lesser status. Although his relationship to other members of the district is considered analogous to the relationship of a leader to his own lineage mates, it is actually considerably weaker. For example, the chief cannot [Page 76]Figure 6. Current Father-to-Child Links among the Lineages in District I.(Each line represents a living father and his child [children] or a living child [children] alone.)order individuals, other than those of his own lineage, to contribute labor and valuables to a district project. The main function of the chief is to call meetings when matters arise that are significant to the entire district. At such meetings, the chief, the lineage leaders, and other elder men decide what should be done. Once action is decided upon, each lineage is assigned its part. When a feast is to be held, each lineage provides a share of the food. If a new meeting house is to be built, each lineage contributes materials. If physical labor is required, all men of the district may work together as a group. However, the chief and the other elders do not have the power to force compliance, nor can they punish anyone who performs evil acts. As indicated above, the lineage is responsible for protecting the individual’s interests."																															1081	No	"Since they want to keep the lineage together, members try to settle internal disputes. This is dramatically evident whenever two lineage mates get into a fight. Other members call on them to cease while trying to pull them apart. Once separated, disarmed and physically restrained, they are scolded and warned against continuing their conflict. In fights with outsiders, lineage mates usually join in to help each other. When people of the same lineage get into a dispute, the lineage leader and other older adults may meet with them to express sympathy and urge forgiveness. The elders’ power over valuables adds an implicit threat to such persuasion."																															1082	No	"While a Land and Claims Office and District Courts have been set up, most land disputes continue to be arbitrated by the island chiefs and certain respected elders. Such arbitration is slow and usually requires a number of hearings, each months apart. The arbitrators do not feel that they can force a settlement, even if they themselves are sure of the just disposition of the case. If they make a proposal, which one of the disputants rejects, the arbitrators abandon attempts temporarily. The disputants often get into heated arguments: The arbitrator does his best to calm them but if this fails he stops the hearing, to resume again in a [Page 206] few weeks or months. Technically the island chiefs have the right to adjudicate temporary occupancy of disputed land but they rarely use this authority to enforce their beliefs and decisions when they are arbitrating a land dispute. It is believed that this pattern of long drawn-out arbitration is at least partly a hold-over from aboriginal times. Customary rules of land tenure are not clear on some points, as indicated above (e.g., the question of whether the older brother is entitled to a larger share of his father’s or lineage land). The average individual does not consider himself an authority on such points and thinks that only the chiefs and certain elders know in detail the proper practice. This attitude allows considerable flexibility and room for compromise in the arbitration. "																															1083	No	"In all villages there is land which belongs specifically to the chiefly lineage. In addition, the hereditary village chiefs were formerly considered to have a sort of right of eminent domain over all the land in their village by virtue of their descent from the first people or by later conquest. Apparently this right was never exercised except in quarrels or rebellions. There is no report that the chief could re-apportion land to the needy, for instance."																															1084	No	"In general the village chief is entitled to the very first fruits from any crops. While formerly presentations were also made to the ancestral spirits, these have been abandoned except possibly on a few of the western islands. The amount of the true first fruit presentation is usually rather small and does not take a great deal of trouble. Types of food crops for which such presentations are made vary from island to island but always include breadfruit, usually the giant swamp taro, and often other kinds of garden produce, certain kinds of fish, palm toddy. The presentation to the lineage heads and original land owners are made after the presentation to the village chiefs - in some islands in conjunction [Page 209] on the same day. The food is often presented uncooked. Usually only the chiefs and their immediate families eat this food.In addition, there are also “chiefs’ feasts” in Truk proper and in the northern and western islands. For these large amounts of food are prepared. Although they are performed in the name of the chiefs who receive the choicest food, it is said that actually they are for the entertainment of the people. Everyone eats his full and there is no feeling of resentment at the work involved."																															1085	No	"There existed on Truk a class of men whom we might call magicians, but who were far more than this. They were the repositories of all the important esoteric lore: the mythology, traditional history, and the ultimate rites of sorcery and divination. As such, their power was immense and their prestige greater than even the chiefs, an office they sometimes undertook themselves. They used a specially modified language known only to themselves and trained novices for years to join their ranks, imparting the final, crucial knowledge only to those worthy of bearing it."																															1086	No	"A few polygynous marriages are still in effect on Truk, made some time prior to their being outlawed. The husbands are primarily chiefs or men of high prestige; this condition apparently also obtained in the past. There have been no such marriages on Romonum in recent years and little information is available in regard to the conditions surrounding them."																															1087	No	"The combination of security and anxiety which is associated with a man’s status within his lineage and in respect to his wife’s household can hardly encourage him to set himself apart from these relatives, or particularly to stand in opposition to them. The role of impartial arbiter, judge, and executive which accrues to the position of island chief cannot, therefore, be expected to be welcomed by most men....We have already mentioned Theodore’s reluctance to take on such a job and his resignation, achieved through a threat of suicide. His comment on his chieftainship is revealing of his discomfort while in the job:Now I just do my own work and don’t have any trouble; I speak gently to the chief and get along with everybody. When I was chief it was very hard; I was always coming and going, to Dublon and Udot, and having to talk a lot to the people when they were bad. But now I just do my own work and don’t worry about anything. I hold no prejudices against anyone; I just want to join happily with everyone I know."																															1088	No	"The traditional chiefs still wielded authority in 1964 over the conservation of food resources in their districts, tabooing for a [Page 82] time the harvesting of coconuts for copra in one district, for example, and controlling the times when harvesting and eating fresh breadfruit, preserved breadfruit, and taro might begin. There were, however, no ceremonial presentations of first fruits to either district chief in 1964-65, as there had been in 1947. The chiefs of the two districts consulted with one another to coordinate the timing of the opening of the different harvest seasons, but they were free to act independently and did so when they felt the occasion required it."																															1089	No	"A good chief was expected to use his position in this way to try to keep peace in his district and see that no injustices were done by one lineage to another. At assemblies in his meeting house, he would preach to the people against theft, murder, and adultery, the three acts mostly likely to lead to a serious breach of the peace. When disputes arose, he would try to act as mediator and bring quarreling lineages to a peaceful solution of their problem.It was expected of a good chief that he would be mosonoson (a person of humility) in his dealings with others and not display namanam tekija (arrogant behavior). For example, it was bad form for a chief personally to express his displeasure with people, to scold them publicly, or personally to order them to prepare for one of the regular feasts which were his due. When dealing authoritatively with his people, he was expected to do so indirectly. It was his mwääninyk (younger brothers) and children who came to the people and told them that their behavior was not meeting with the chief’s approval, or who let it be known that a feast would be held in the chief’s honor on a certain day. 12 A chief who orders people around directly is likely to be unpopular. 13"																															1090	No	"As potential heirs to the chiefship, the children of a chief were accorded special privileges in aboriginal times. They, the jëfëkyren sömwon ( jëfëkyr of the chief), were not classed with the rest of the people, jaramas. Together with the next younger brother of the chief, they occupied seats of honor in the meeting house and were privileged to harangue the people. A chief’s death, followed by his younger brother’s assumption of office, did not terminate the privileges enjoyed by the children of the former chief. They continued to exercise them until their death, for they were still among the potential heirs to the chiefship. These privileges were held only by a chief’s own children. They could not in turn be passed to their children or lineage mates."																															1091	No	"A chief represents his district in inter-district relations and in aboriginal times led the people of his district in war. He organized the military campaign, ascertained that all necessary preparations were made, had diviners determine auspicious days for attack, and saw to it that the available magical specialists employed all the magic they knew in order to inflict sickness upon the enemy and render all counter-magic harmless. If his district was getting the worst of it, the chief made proper representation to the victors for ending the war and making peace. A decision to go to war, however, did not rest entirely with the chief. His wish for war could be vetoed by the adult men of his district, who assembled in his meeting house to discuss the matter. A chief, in turn, could veto a desire for war expressed by his people, the approval of both being required. When war was decided on, a chief assembled the adult men to determine appropriate plans of action. The man with most prestige as a strategist and tactician was the one whose words carried the most weight, regardless of whether or not he was a chief, while the man most skilled as a fighter led the military expedition. The chief acted as manager and coordinator. He had no legal right to compel any person in his district to go to war. If someone refused to take part, the chief would be angry but could not force him. He would assign such a person the job of staying home as a guard for the women and children."																															1092	No	"The traditional leaders for whom Trukese had the utmost awe, fear and respect were the war leaders or Iitag. Just as those persons with the kindest and most gentle character were often recruited as breadfruit or fish callers, so the bravest, most arrogant, most machiavellian persons were urged to become war leaders. When fully trained, these officials were tie only ones capable of uniting people of diverse lineages, clans, villages and islands, keeping them in line, and getting them to act in concert at least for a while.To help make their speech and their persons as hot and fearsome as possible, war leaders often dressed themselves in an unkempt, ragged manner. They also learned as much as they could about the hot or strong spirit powers. A number of these, which we have already listed, were considered more or less the exclusive property of war leaders, although their knowledge was not limited to these alone. The result of this training, therefore, was to [Page 192] make ordinary people afraid to eat with them or even to eat in their presence. War leaders consequently tended to be segregated off as a special and fearsome category of persons. It was dangerous to get too close to them, for their mere touch or simply an angry word or look could very well prove to be fatal.Although opportunities to test their skills in actual warfare are denied war leaders today, many individual Trukese still possess a reputation for such learning, and a few are continuing to pass the knowledge on to their descendants. Thus, while there hasn’t been any formal training of war leaders in decades, those thought to possess the knowledge are still treated with considerable deference--for their powers are still viable, and can cause death."																															1093	No	"Few women have been prominent in the modern politics of Pacific island countries, and no nation in Oceania is led by a woman today. According to a recent study completed by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), women’s heavy underrepresentation in decision-making positions characterizes nearly the entire Asia and Pacific region ( Marianas Variety News & Views, November 14, 1986, p. 25). In some Micronesian communities women occasionally assumed positions of political leadership (the exception rather than the rule). For example, in 1958 the woman who headed the highest-ranking clan on Ifaluk Atoll in Yap District assumed the role of atoll chief upon the death of her male predecessor and remained in this position until her own death in 1964 (U.S. Department of State 1964:103). Women served as traditional chiefs in the mid-1960s on Lamotrek and Wottagai in the outer islands of Yap District, and on Ailuk, Aur, Maloelap, Utirik, and Wotje in the Marshall Islands in the 1970s (U.S. Department of State 1966:102, 1971:104). The House of Iroij in the Marshall Islands Congress during 1951-1952 had five women members, but all were there by virtue of holding titles to traditional chieftainships and not because they were elected (Meller 1969:86; U.S. Department of State 1960:89)."																															1094	No	"Ideally, Trukese leaders—whether women or men—should possess certain characteristics. A leader must solve problems effectively and creatively. Formal education and foreign travel (which provides a source of new ideas to draw upon in solving problems) would seem essential in leadership development. Also a leader ought to be a hard worker, one who follows through on her or his proposals. In the Trukese view a person who merely suggests what to do but is unwilling or unable to organize and press ideas into action is not a true leader.Leaders also must have specific social skills before others will take them seriously and, potentially, follow them. Chief among these skills is public speaking—an ability to speak out politely but forcefully and a willingness [Page 56] to take a public stand in a firm and appropriate manner no matter who might be in the audience. Fluent English is a helpful adjunct to public speaking but not an essential requirement for many leadership positions in Truk. 1212. Although it is true that some elective offices, particularly in municipal government (e.g., councillor), do not require English language skills, some elective positions in state government (e.g., legislator, governor, lieutenant governor) have an unstated but basic requirement for facility in English. This is because state government officials must meet and deal with persons from elsewhere in the Federated States or from the United States who do not speak or understand Trukese. Even by 1970, responses to a political attitudes questionnaire administered to citizens of Namoluk Atoll revealed the importance of English language ability for offices such as legislator (Marshall and Borthwick 1974).Go to end note page. A good leader must mingle well in the community and in a variety of social groups. Leaders should be able to organize other people and get them to accept the leader’s direction in the process of getting things done."																															1095	No	"If we may judge from the present, the chief’s function in the gardening cycle has long been that of an “announcer;” that is, he tells the group to do what it is about to do anyway, since the ripeness of the fruit or tubers to be gathered allows relatively little variation as to when to begin to harvest. Of course, if there is a shortage of food, there may be a wish to begin the harvest before the ripening is completed, but the chief can be counted upon to grant special dispensation to those in difficult circumstances, or to begin the harvest early if food generally is in low supply. It should be noted that among the few traditional prerogatives of the chief are receiving first fruits at harvest time, being served special portions of food at feasts, and being presented with any unusually large fish caught."																															1096	No	"The chief functioned in two areas of active leadership. The first concerned maintenance of peace among the lineages recognizing him as chief. Should a dispute occur over land rights or a case of adultery—these are said to have been the main causes of interlineage disputes—the heads of the contending lineages would come to the head of the higher-ranked lineage and present their cases. The chief would then consider the merits of the case, and, with the help of gifts from the disputants, decide which was the just side. Having made this decision, he publicly announced it or, at least, made his position widely known. Public knowledge of the opinion of the supposedly disinterested chief was sometimes sufficient to bring the losing side of the dispute to comply with the solution he suggested rather than suffer the shame ( mäffin) of disapprobation. If public opinion were not enough, the likelihood that the chief would ally his [Page 20] lineage with the kin group with which he agreed often forced the losers of the litigation to comply with his decision, since the two combined kin groups would be likely to triumph should war occur."																															1097	No	"The second sphere of leadership for the chief was warfare itself. The chief’s function was to decide, with the assistance of his subordinate lineage heads and specialists in magic and esoteric knowledge ( itang), when and where war was to be joined, and with whom. The chief also participated in planning the strategy of battle and in the negotiations after fighting had ceased, although the magical specialists had as much or more weight in this planning."																															1098	No	"Humble behavior ( mösonousón) is, for the Trukese, among the most highly valued types of conduct and any active leadership on the part of a lineage [Page 25] head would be quite “unhumble.” Ordering people about for whatever reason, confidently voicing opinions, even speaking loudly enough to be heard easily—these are all violations of the valued humble behavior. The lineage head finds himself in the position of one who can order people about and can express definite opinions that will not only be listened to, but will also be acted upon. In fact, by the nature of his status he is expected to do so. People are always complaining about the failure of lineage heads to be vigorous ( ouchouchou) and wise ( tipachem) in prosecuting the affairs of their lineages."																															1099	No	"Ngoneulu and Vunisea originate from Moala from the clan of Manukui. Nggitawa came from Vuna to Yathata, and Yathata to Thithia; among them was Lalinggavoka who became chief because he was strong. All the chiefs nowadays are chiefs by the strength of their hands, whereas the true chiefs live like common people. The village of Natheva holds the rank of mbath"																															1100	No	"One informant draws a picture of an ideal chief:Of old, Tui Naiau was as our father. If people wanted manufactured articles they went and begged of him. The people of Lakemba went to the nobleman on whom they leaned for support, and he would take them with their small feast to Big House. It was hard for the chief to refuse a thing: all the food brought to him was distributed among them all.The chief's dues were described by the following terms:If a chief wanted a thing he told a village to do it. This is called lala . [May be translated as requisition, statute labor corresponding to the Sinhalese rajakariya , “King's work.”] The chief had to feed the people who worked for him, and the feast so made was called otho . Formerly a chief killed himself with work on account of his requisitions because he had to attend to the men who came to do statute labor for him."																															1101	No	House-building now is a poor affair compared with what it used to be. Of old the whole of Lakemba would come to build the Tui Naiau's house. Villages would work for a nobleman who was connected with them. If a man of Tumbou wished to have a house built he would carry a feast to the chief with his request; the chief would assign a certain village to build the house; of course the man had to feed them.																															1102	No	"“Few high chiefs,” says a nobleman, “were not killed. If one was kind to the people of the land he was not clubbed. Some were killed because they entered houses and took other people's wives. That is why our forefathers of Naivi were killed because they were handsome and fond of women.” The two reasons why a chief was killed, according to one were “adultery and eating badly,” that is eating the feasts brought without sharing them with the people."																															1103	No	"The succession is through the father, yet the descendants of an elder sister are thought far more of than any descendants through males; and, though not qualified for the chieftainship, yet rank higher than the chief. The great prestige an elder sister possesses may be the relic of custom which still obtains in Tonga of ranking the descendants in the female line higher than those descended through males. This may explain the word kaisi : this is usually explained as having been originally a term of abuse; but semen-man would in Fijian be tamata si , not kaisi , which should mean “one of the nationality of the semen”; comparing kete , womb, for a descendant in the female line, kaisi would then be properly a descendant in the male line, and therefore one of inferior rank; turanga would be a descendant in the female line, one of higher rank."																															1104	No	"The recently created political office of village headman plays an important part in village affairs. The village headman is responsible for the actual enforcement of the native regulations which provide for the communal performance of all activities considered beneficial to the community. These activities include gardening, village planning, house building and sanitation, maintenance of roads and communal property, and the control of infectious diseases. Besides these executive duties the headman welcomes guests and calls village assemblies to decide matters of communal importance."																															1105	No	"Theoretically the headman of the highest ranking clan is the high chief of Lau and to him all islands pay tribute. The chief is assisted by officials who hold graded hereditary clan titles. Chiefs or minor chiefdoms are headmen of ranking island clans. They receive tribute from the villages of their petty domains. They, in turn, have graded assistants.The title of highest rank in Lau is the Roko Sau, chief of Naiau. He is the chief of Lakemba and Naiau islands, and he is the high chief of Lau to whom all the islands in the chiefdom pay tribute. The title of chief of Lakemba, which he should logically hold also, exists in Fiji only as the ceremonial title of a forefather god. According to Williams (27, vol. 1, p. 219), the gods, Tokairambe and Tui Lakemba Randinandina, are the sons of Ndengei who ranks supreme among the gods. The title of Tui Lakepa (Lakemba) is found in Tonga. (See also Gifford, 9, p. 34 and Hocart, 13, p. 44.)"																															1106	No	"Formerly the high chief had one principal wife, a woman of high rank chosen either from Lau or from one of the other chiefdoms in Fiji, and several secondary wives ( i solonga ), women of lower rank, from Lakemba or the outlying islands. The relative rank of the offspring of the chief depended upon the rank of the mother. Children of the principal wife were called turanga , those of the other wives i kaso . Now the high chief has but one wife."																															1107	No	"The high chief has heavy responsibilities in the maintenance of his clan obligations and ceremonial court life. He has a large number of dependents including many of his relatives and retainers, whom he must feed. Because of the soliciting and vasu systems (pp. 62-64, 207-208) he is constantly approached for gifts or loans."																															1108	No	"The high chief is sacred. As the shrine of ancestor gods of highest rank he has more mana than anyone else in his chiefdom. An elaborate system of tabus protects him. His head, the center of mana, is the most sacred part of his person. It may not be touched, nor may his comb and headrest be used by anyone else. (See 27, vol. 1, p. 25.) Only a man of high rank is allowed to wear a turban ( faufau ) in the village. The chief's wearing apparel and sleeping mats are tabu. Only a chief may wear the long streamers of barkcloth ( tchini puli ) as part of his ceremonial, the chest band ( wambale ), or the breast plate inlaid with mother-of-pearl ( thiva vonovono ). Only a member of the chief's family is allowed to wear a hair ornament of feathers ( tekiteki ). The royal staff ( matanakilangi ), presented to the high chief at his installation, is also an emblem of royalty (27, vol. 1, p. 25)."																															1110	No	"Cases of dispute over land, due either to contested boundaries or to collateral inheritance, are common. Normally the people concerned settle their own differences. Sometimes, however, if a man of rank feels that public concord is being outraged too openly he will endeavour to reconcile the parties and suggest a form of amicable arrangement. This he does on his own initiative, not as a piece of set procedure. As a rule the chief does not act in the matter; he may in conversation state his opinion as to the relative merits of the claims advanced, but the settlement of the case does not immediately concern him. In certain circumstances, however, he may exercise his authority and give a pronouncement. In theory all the land of the clan is held at the disposal of the chief, and some portions of it were actually [Page 175] handed over by his ancestors to clan members in bygone generations. If land of this type is under dispute and the trouble appears to be serious, perhaps likely to lead to bloodshed, or if the chief becomes irritated at the news of the bickering, he sends a messenger with an ultimatum to the people concerned. This may embody a decision against one party, bidding them ‘sit down’ and yield to their opponents. More often it is to the effect that if they do not speedily resolve their differences he will resume the land himself and drive off both parties. This threat has usually the desired effect. Where land is so scarce the entire loss of a garden or orchard is a serious matter, apart from incurring the displeasure of the chief, so that some compromise is generally arranged."																															1111	No	"Apart from these ordinary measures the chief has one mode of reprisal in which he has exceptional advantages. This is the practice of black magic, tautuku . By its recital he is believed to be able to inflict illness on anyone who offends him, through the intermediacy of his gods. The power of a chief in this direction is feared, though not, apparently, to the extent of deterring persons from raiding his crops without authorization. But as a rule theft is not followed by an appeal to black magic. This is a secret measure of retaliation, and though its use may be regarded as justified, the consequences are not approved by the community. The tautuku is bad because, it is believed, it makes people ill, and they may die. Whatever the provocation then, the action of a person--commoner or chief--who employs or is believed to employ such a device is always condemned--though not, of course, to his face. The tautuku is a traditional institution, regarded as a reality, utilized as a means of private retaliation, but regarded with disapprobation by the community in general. Its use in any specific instance is suspected but not normally disclosed."																															1112	No	"I did not obtain any accurate measure of the possession of economic lore by different sections of the population. But on the whole chiefs are more knowledgeable than commoners. This is due in the first place to their superior opportunities for receiving instruction. A young man who is regarded as the probable heir to the chieftainship is told by his father and by other elders a great deal of ritual information which is not imparted to others not in the line of succession. Again, the context of chieftainship itself tends to promote a more elaborate equipment of information because on so many occasions the chief must take the initiative and must recite the appropriate formulae. Hence if he succeeds to the chieftainship without having received from his father a proper store of knowledge, he will apply to his father's brother, or even his father's sister or to another chief who is known to have been well instructed. A basket of food is the appropriate introduction to such request. On the whole, too, elderly men are more knowledgeable than younger men, if only for the reason that they have had many more opportunities of exchanging opinions, hearing traditional stories, correcting ideas and filling in the gaps. Again, a younger man of rank will not normally know as much as his father because in native belief if a chief or elder imparts the last vestiges of his ritual knowledge to his son, then the gods regard that as a sign that he is [Page 104] finished with the affairs of this world and will soon make him die. Only when he is very old or ill does he divulge the information."																															1113	No	"Leadership in Tikopia co-operative work relies upon two principles, that of social status and that of skill. The most extreme example of the first is where a chief assumes command in such an enterprise as the production of sago or turmeric; of the second where a canoe builder is in charge of the making of a chief's craft. In the first case men who have more technical deftness may be subordinate to the directions of their senior in rank; in the second case the chief has his function as provider of food and future owner of the canoe but the commands of the expert are obeyed by him in all technical matters. These two principles are not exclusive; the chief is himself frequently an acknowledged technician and so has a double right of leadership. Or conversely the canoe builder who is in charge may be himself a man of rank either in ritual affairs or in the political sphere. [Page 145] Moreover, in a sense, acknowledged skill in the major crafts gives in itself the title to direction of the work and has a social value. The basis of distinction is the amount of proficiency involved, which is correlated with the liability to failure. In the activities which demand less proficiency and in which the range of technical competence from man to man is not so great, the possession of ritual status tends to be the determining factor. In the activities where this variation in technical competence is most significant, as in canoe building, the technician is for obvious reasons the leader in his own sphere. In some communities, as in Melanesia, he tends to be the ritual practitioner as well, thus controlling both sides of the activity. In Tikopia this is not so. When a chief is having a new sacred canoe constructed he cannot be the craftsman. He must enlist the services of such a man while the technical aspects of the activity are carried on within a ritual framework in which he himself has the directing voice. Even if he is himself an acknowledged craftsman he conforms to the division of function between provider of food and executor of the work."																															1114	No	"The native economic organization is conditioned by the fact that to some extent the children of a chief share in the restrictions and privileges which attach to his position. In the general social field they have something of his tapu . They may not be insulted with impunity, nor may they be struck by commoners. Even between themselves these rules are observed. I once saw a son of the Ariki Kafika rate soundly a number of children who had been obstructing an activity. He then observed that one of the younger sons of the Ariki Taumako was among them and said: “What I said was not meant for you, friend. I was talking to the children here.”"																															1115	No	"In the economic field, however, it is the eldest son who is of special importance. He takes a prominent part in the productive activities of his clan, or of his village. Like his father, he does not participate as a rule in the actual oven work on a ceremonial occasion, although he attends and helps in directing the activity, and in his own home does take part in cooking. But he assumes by right the leadership of many co-operative activities, as a communal fish drive, or the preparation of a sago oven. Again, he imposes economic tapu of a wide range and assumes responsibility for the welfare of his whole clan (see p. 208). This his younger brothers do not do."																															1116	No	"In Tikopia a chief has normally a greater command of economic resources than others of his clan. In his position he is overlord and principal owner-holder of clan lands, and of clan canoes. 1v. We, The Tikopia , ch. xi, for an analysis of chieftainship and land tenure; and Chapter VII of the present book for a summary of land and canoe ownership (also end of this chapter, p. 218).[Page 191] In relation to his clan he stands at the focal point of distribution in addition to being the prime mover in production."																															1117	No	"Although the chief, like other men, is expected to take an active part in the productive activities of his household, certain ceremonial and magico-religious restrictions, depending on his rank, are imposed upon him in this respect. Unlike other men, he should not carry burdens; his adze, his staff, his fishing tackle, his little bag of betel materials should constitute all his load. Coco-nuts, bananas, taro and whatever he may wish to bring from his cultivations should be borne by others. Travelling alone with the Ariki Kafika on one occasion I was even given coco-nuts to carry by a man we met in an orchard, with the remark that “the chief does not shoulder burdens”. He may [Page 192] take part in the preparation of food for the oven, but not in the actual work of cooking. Like everyone else he is subject to the obligations incurred by marriage but when such obligations would require him to cook, his son or his younger brother goes in his stead. If he is a young man the chief may attend the kindling of an oven and sit down modestly to help. He will begin, for instance, to grate taro. But he is never left very long at such work--soon one of his people comes up and replaces him."																															1118	No	"Finally, reference should be made to the energy expended by the chiefs in carrying out their non-economic ritual duties, which sometimes involve considerable effort. Thus in regard to the series of daily visits which formerly had to be paid by the Ariki Tafua to Uta during the Work of the Gods--to put marks of turmeric pigment on different parts of his temple, to participate in ceremonial food preparing, etc., the chief said to me: “It is all right for a younger man, but for an old man, no--he [Page 199] becomes sick of it. It is all right if he is living in Namo and can come by canoe, but when one is living in Faea--one becomes very tired.”t may be asked if these ritual obligations are treated seriously by the chiefs. In Tikopia they certainly are. For instance the Ariki Kafika, I noticed, was pale one day at a kava ceremony. He told me that he had fasted for two days and nights before the ceremony, and said that this was always the case before the seasonal Work of the Gods. He kept on thinking of the Work so that his food became bitter to him, there was no flavour and aroma in it for him. These statements fit in with my observations on his nervous disposition. I doubt if the other chiefs take their responsibilities so seriously, though they do conform to them regularly."																															1119	No	"When a chief plays the part of economic agent by engaging the services of a number of people, including expert craftsmen, to prepare a piece of capital equipment, such as a canoe or a seine net, he reciprocates the services of these people by gifts of bark-cloth, etc., and food. In this he behaves as any other men of wealth in the community. The difference is that his reciprocation is apt to be on a more generous scale. In any case, social obligations require him to furnish a certain amount of this productive equipment for the service of his gods and the [Page 200] use of his clan. A man who wishes to go fishing and has no canoe of his own may borrow that of the chief after obtaining permission. When he returns he gives the catch to the chief, who distributes it, returning the larger portion to the canoe crew and keeping a little for himself. (The borrowing of a fellow clansman's canoe on the same principle is also common.) The chief's productive equipment stands as it were at the apex of that of his clan and to some extent is representative of it for esoteric purposes. 1This applies particularly to his sacred canoes, the equipment for turmeric making and nets for lake fishing.When a chief's net is being made or repaired the kava is performed daily; so also with his sea-going canoes."																															1120	No	"Allied to this last function is that of the chief as an integrator of production. Seasonally he performs ceremonies which are intended to increase the catch of fish and to some extent to serve as a framework within which people pursue their fishing. Each chief, moreover, has one of the major vegetable foodstuffs under his control and in the last resort is held responsible for its fertility. 2v. “Totemism in Polynesia,” 5-10, for an account of this.The people of his clan do not plant or gather these foods only because they have to make contributions of them when the chief performs his ritual, but their obligation to make these contributions when required is one factor in the interest which they have in them. They do believe firmly that their capacity to use this foodstuff depends on the actions of the chief, his personal power and his feelings towards them and the community as a whole."																															1121	No	"So far we have dealt primarily with the ways in which a chief influences production. His role in distribution and consumption [Page 213] is equally important. Stated briefly, he is the recipient from his people of periodic gifts of food and special types of raw material which, sporadic in the case of any individual contributor, nevertheless form in toto a steady stream of additions to his wealth. But the position is not merely one-sided, for a great deal of what he receives he redistributes, and with his family's help he must reciprocate the initial gifts, though not necessarily to an equal extent. Here the important thing is the material acknowledgment of the contribution; the exact amount of the acknowledgment is not of such moment. In Tikopia the chief is not in the position of a simple receiver of tribute, retaining a portion and redistributing the rest. His own orchards and other resources are drawn upon largely to the advantage of his people; and his capital goods such as canoes are used to a considerable extent by them. 1"																															1122	No	An important part of the chief's income are the gifts of food [Page 217] that he receives from members of his clan and from other chiefs when they themselves have performed an important ceremony																															1123	No	"One important feature of the chief's role in consumption is the generosity that is expected from him. By convention he should send surpluses of food from his household to members of his clan, pass on to them baskets of food received from other sources, and always have on hand some tobacco and betel materials for distribution to those who call on him. The economic aspect of visiting and granting of hospitality is very marked."																															1124	No	"In summarizing the social effects of this series of feasts there are three sets of personal considerations: as an offset to the expenditure of time, labour, and wealth the chief himself, the members of his clan, and his guests from the other clans must get some recompense. The chief himself fulfils a traditional obligation, makes use of his command of wealth to maintain his reputation and sets the seal upon his status. His people become a focus of social interest at second hand, indirectry acquire prestige through the size of the feast, and are able to demonstrate in a material way their fidelity to their leader. The guests consume and take away quantities of food, more than they contribute, and receive wealth of a more permanent kind."																															1125	No	"In this chapter the chief has been shown to be the most important single human factor in the economic life of the Tikopia. Not only does he play a part as a producer within his immediate household, but by initiative and example he gives direction to the productive work of the community; he is titular owner of the most valuable property of the members of his clan; he imposes far-reaching restrictions on production and consumption and in many important activities he acts as a focal point in the processes of exchange and distribution."																															1126	No	"In Tikopia succession to chieftainship is generational, restricted to males, and hereditary. It normally takes place only on the death of the incumbent; there is no rotation of office and no recognized provision for retirement."																															1127	No	"If one asks the question, what has been demanded of a chief in Tikopia, what qualities should be possessed, one does not get a neatly rounded formulation of an ideal personality responding to a clearly demarcated set of obligations. The ideal of what a chief should be can only be extracted piecemeal from the judgments of people expressed upon his behaviour in concrete situations, and from isolated statements of principle often arising from these situations. The most explicit generalizations have come not from the people, but from the chiefs themselves and the members of their families, whose consciousness of the chiefly role has been most acute. From my experience in 1928-29 and 1952 it may be said very broadly that all Tikopia held that the chiefs were the guardians of the interests of their people, and that this demanded from the chief certain types of conduct, including abstention from direct injury to his people through selfish motives, and limitations upon his freedom of action where this freedom might be indirectly prejudicial to them. Traditionally this position was correlative with their function as priests, that is, as representatives and intermediaries with the Tikopia gods. The Tikopia chief could be, in theory, a dictator. In practice, his power and authority were subject to limitations imposed by the very character of that authority. The efficacy of the limitations upon him depended to a large extent on his conception of trusteeship."																															1128	No	"In many contexts it was implied that a Tikopia chief should be a mature man, capable of making responsible decisions. The Ariki Tafua described to me in 1952 how his father when very ill looked on his son who had become a man ( ku tauguta ) and was ready then to abandon life, in the thought that it was time be succeeded to the chieftainship. And I think it is significant that although at least one case is recorded of a chief having been elected as a minor there is no case of a chief having been elected in absentia --on a sea voyage abroad.Of the other qualities that were demanded of a chief, one was physical health. If his body was not hale, then he could not serve efficiently as a representative of his people and a medium for his gods.In addition to physical purity, it was thought that a chief should have a certain moral purity. The ethical side of their religion was not strongly emphasized by the Tikopia, but it was asserted that sorcery should lie outside the province of a chief. [Page 164] In 1929 the Ariki Taumako said to me. “A chief should continue to dwell beautifully only, to make the have ; it is made only for welfare, for food to be good.” The term translated as “beautifully” could also be rendered as “in proper style,” that is, “without evil intent.”A chief in relation to commoners, then, was expected to be someone superior, somewhat aloof, capable of fierceness when angered, but compassionate."																															1129	No	"Apart from the objection to the triple marriage, two points of importance are embodied in this whole statement. One is that the marital affairs of a chief or even of a potential chief are also the concern of the clan. They regard themselves as entitled to provide him with a wife and bound to protest if that wife leaves him, even although she may have been provoked into doing so. Secondly, the degree of attachment between can and chief is to some extent dependent upon the hospitality which his wife will exercise. "																															1130	No	"A chief, however, can give the culprit sanctuary, and Asikanu, being a chief’s brother, was protected by the chief while negotiations were being carried on in his behalf. Now he was sent away from home to be one of our paddlers so that the enraged husband might be dealt with—time helps to cool anger. This was important in Asikanu’s case, since the husband of the woman who had gone to Asikanu would consent to no fine, however large, and seemed, furthermore, to have misgivings about the manner in which the ritual beating would be conducted. “I will kill myself,” he had been heard to declare. “I will kill myself, and give them all kunu. My yorka—ghost—will come to [Page [75]] trouble them, and I will give the family a kunu, and the clan, too, because the chief has shielded him. I am powerless against the chief. I will kill myself.”"																															1131	No	"The presences of a shaman, a chanter and a lead dancer are required at any communal ritual among the Makuna. All of them have recognized specialist knowledge and therefore high status in Makuna society. However, little differentiates them from ordinary men in daily life. They have no economic privileges—except the payments received by the shaman for his services—and their status is not expressed in any way outside the ritual realm. A single man may combine all these three statuses, though this is rare. If a man is shaman, chanter and lead dancer, his prestige is exceptionally great. He is likely to have several wives and to be an influential political leader."																															1133	No	"The concept of political leadership among the Makuna is closely tied to the concept of ownership. [unknown]Uh[unknown]u means both leader and owner. In the leadership [Page 84] aspect, the term generally refers to the representative and accepted leader of any stable, corporate group larger than the elementary household. The concept of [unknown]uh[unknown]u is as flexible and ample as the political organization itself; it denotes any leader, from the headman of a residence group to legendary tribal chiefs and mythical heroes. In the ownership aspect, the term [unknown]uh[unknown]u refers to shared rights in collective property. Again, it has ample connotations; it may refer to the actual ownership of a house or ritual property or to the ownership of a river or tract of land in the context of myth and descent ideology. The close relationship between these two aspects is manifest in the status of the headman/house-owner; he represents both the collective ownership of the house and the leadership of the corporate group of kinsmen inhabiting it."																															1134	No	"The status of a local leader—whatever the range of his influence and the size of his following—depends on popular support and recognition. To become a local leader, a man must combine a series of ascribed and achieved statuses, the minimum number of which are the status of headman and house-owner, senior status within a numerically strong and high-ranking sib (which generally goes with a peak position in the local network of marriage alliances) and, finally, one or more important ritual statuses."																															1135	No	"To be a local leader means the endless sponsoring of communal rituals for the good of the people—his followers. But sponsoring communal rituals also means gaining prestige, displaying and consolidating power, as well as extending the [Page 86] range of influence. By frequently sponsoring communal rituals, the leader creates a following of dependants."																															1136	No	"The proliferation of local dance rituals in the Lower Komeña group serves to consolidate the local group as a political unit and to define its boundaries in relation to other groups. At the same time, however, it indicates an element of internal political competition: one headman strives to consolidate his position as local leader against other headmen, who strive for political independence. All in all, the large number of local dance festivals in the Lower Komeña group points to the presence of a local leader, engaged in sponsoring rituals to fulfil his duties to his followers, but also in order to consolidate and extend his authority."																															1137	No	"A successful leader needs to have access to the services of shamans, chanters and lead dancers, in order to sponsor communal rituals. Antonio is himself a chanter and lead dancer. His younger brother is a well-known chanter and there are several lead dancers among his followers. "																															1138	No	"At this point, it is appropriate to sum up the role and typical career of a local leader among the Makuna. The political leader ( [unknown]uh[unknown]u ) is, in general, a man who thinks and speaks well. Oratorical skill is one of the basic requirements and [Page 88] qualities of a prestigious leader. Thinking and speaking well mean that he knows how to deal with people, how to prevent social conflict and how to settle disputes and restore social order. The handling of the potentially disruptive, affinal relationships and the sponsoring of communal rituals are the two most important functions of the Makuna leader. Through his oratorical skill-displayed in ceremonial dialogues-disputes are settled and the interests of his followers defended. Through the communal rituals, the social-and ultimately cosmi—corder is maintained or restored."																															1139	No	"The role of the political leader is well defined in Makuna society. It is a specialist role of the same kind as the ritual specialist roles described above. In fact, the role of the political leader is a direct complement to the role of the shaman: while the shaman is a supernatural mediator-a mediator between men and spirits-the political leader is a social mediator-a mediator between men and social groups. The leader represents his group in relation to outsiders of his own kind (human beings), while the shaman deals with non-human “outsiders”, that is, spirits.An informant nearly summarized the typical career of a political leader: “A man who wants to become an [unknown]uh[unknown]u must work hard. He must build a large house, cut large gardens and sponsor many dances. He must make a lot of beer and coca and invite many people. He must think good for his people and know how to greet visitors and how to handle enemies. He must be strong and wise.”"																															1140	No	"The common attributes of a successful leader are a big longhouse, a large, polygamous family and large gardens. All these attributes are functionally connected with his role as leader: he needs a big house, a large work-force and large gardens, in order to sponsor many communal rituals. Many children secure the strength of his descent line. Even one polygamous marriage has a considerable demographic impact-in terms of the number of offspring-in a small population like that of the Makuna."																															1141	No	"The mechanisms of social control in Makuna society are largely embedded in the social system itself, in the actual working of the system of kinship and marriage, and in the belief in sorcery and supernatural sanctions. Only in times of open conflict and overt dispute is the political structure activated and made explicit; the boundaries of political units and the functions of political leaders are defined and [Page 89] redefined. Deaths-followed by the accusation or suspicion of sorcery-and unsuccessful marriage arrangements or bride captures are the most common sources of conflict among the Makuna."																															1142	No	"There is a definite correlation between polygyny and high prestige in two ways: on the one hand, only senior and influential men have plural wives and, on the other hand, plural wives convey status and are a means of acquiring prestige among Makuna men. Ambitious headmen strive to take a second wife in order to enhance their prestige. Polygyny is thus both a symbol of high status and a means of acquiring it."																															1143	No	"The role of the local leader-if he exists-is minor and insignificant. Competition for power and prestige between headmen is frequent, and each headman seeks to mobilize support from agnates as well as affines (allies) within the local group. Fission within the residence group is an expression of the competition between agnatic kin on the lowest level of social segmentation. It is said that traditionally disputes between neighbours were settled by ritual sham fights with clubs between the individuals involved."																															1144	No	"THE MEANINGS AND OBLIGATIONS associated with rank are nowhere better illustrated than in the system of reciprocal exchange known as the po[unknown]oa . I have briefly mentioned and will later consider in detail how redistribution operates on the local level: the chief, as senior member of a sib, controls productive sites. In this way, he maintains priority access to strategic resources, allocating them at his discretion to individuals in the local group. The chief thus fulfills his obligation to distribute food and at the same time manifests his “succulence.”"																															1145	No	"The chieftaincy or headmanship of any Wanano village is held by its highest-ranked male. His authority rests on his position as the senior living descendant of the founding ancestor of the local senior sib; he is the “oldest brother” in his generation, known as mahsa wami, “the people’s oldest brother.” He is also called dahpu or “head,” a term that refers not only to his leadership role, but also to the anatomical head, which “leads,” “organizes,” and “speaks for” the human body. These functions of the anatomical head attach to the head of the Wanano village. More specifically, the term refers [Page 127] to the head of the ancestral anaconda, from whose body the exogamous language groups of the Uaupés originated. The highest-ranked male is also called pütoro, which has been translated as both “first” and “chief.” Here I refer to the highest-ranked male as mahsa wami ."																															1146	No	"Wanano chieftainship entails control over three major aspects of village life: fishing resources, labor, and ritual. A mahsa wami must hold sway over all three areas to lead effectively. Inability to harvest and redistribute fish, for example, will make it difficult for the mahsa wami to mobilize and coordinate labor, Control, then, implies the obligation to redistribute.The chief mobilizes and coordinates communal labor, carefully balancing collective projects against individual work such as gardening, so that collective and individual labor do not conflict. I observed several kinds of community projects in Wanano villages, including the construction and maintenance of houses, the clearing and burning of gardens, and the intensive preparations for intersib po?oa exchange ceremonies."																															1147	No	"The mahsa wami is the spokesman for the sib and the community. He must command leadership etiquette, display diplomacy in representing his sib to outsiders, and receive visitors with graciousness and eloquence. The mahsa wami receives and redistributes the gifts presented by other chiefs at po?oa ceremonies held in the chief’s residence, a spacious dance house. His skillful display of oratory and ritual language reflects on the entire sib and manifests high rank."																															1149	No	"The play of young boys often involves food. The young male pack fishes for minnows, traps small game, and forages in the nearby forest for ants, grubs, and fruits. They share all food equally, except that a boy aspiring to be a leader takes a smaller share for himself. This attitude of leadership has its counterpart among adult males. Within the maloca a leader - not necessarily the headman - makes a point of sharing the food he has with the sib even if it is no more than a small fish. Those who are not leaders and who do not aspire to leadership consume small catches of game and fish in the household, reasoning that they have only enough for one family."																															1150	No	"As to formal principles of kinship, the distinction between uterine and agnatic brothers is of no great importance. Most marriages are monogamous and in most families there are no stepchildren. Headmen, however, are generally polygynous, and it is in their households that the distinction assumes some importance. Since a headman’s household is a focal point of sib activity, whatever occurs within it will affect the state of being within the sib and ultimately its unity. Should a cleavage develop among brothers of different wives of the headman it could split the sib. Cleavages develop around rivalry for position. A headman’s sons are inclined to model themselves after the father and to seek leadership of the community. Since the mantle of leadership will in any case fall upon one of them they are, in any case, virtually obligated to seek leadership. "																															1151	No	"It a man has two wives, he must prepare two clearings and set each up in her own household. Even so, my informants told me, the wives quarrel and bear tales against one another to the husband, accusing one another of laziness. The first wife taunts her colleague as being a mere second wife. The second retorts that she would not have been chosen if the husband had really cared for the first wife. Since men take it for granted that women are an unruly element they expect wives to quarrel. A headman, however, should be able to manage them, it is believed."																															1152	No	"The Bah[unknown]ukiwa headman also had had two wives. In his case the second and younger wife succeeded in displacing the older woman. The younger woman insisted that her husband give up sexual relations with his first wife. She bothered him so much that he yielded and told his first wife to leave him. She refused, insisting that she would stay on with her children. An old woman now, she has a grandmother role. A son not yet married has provided her with a small manioc garden. Her relations with the headman and her successor are cool but not unpleasant. That women regard polygyny as contrary to their interests is further indicated by the fact that they are reputed to possess an herb ( pedidya ) which, mixed into a husband’s porridge, causes him to lose interest in acquiring a second wife."																															1153	No	"Leadership among the Cubeo follows a principle that tends to understate authority. This principle asserts that leadership derives from giving more than one receives. Authoritarian relationships, by contrast, follow an opposing principle, that of receiving more than one gives. Authority, to be sure, can be established on a personal basis of personality and prowess. However, societies that have developed strong authority systems have usually done so by economic means, by inequality in the flow of goods. An authority system based on unequal flow of goods upward, from the community to a chief, is likely to respond quickly to economic development, and at the same time to foster economic growth. The Cubeo theory effectively minimizes the economic impact of leadership. The principle of greater flow to the top creates the condition for an expanding economic-political system, whereas the principle of greater flow from the top down creates the conditions for a static political-economic system. The economic role of the Cubeo headman is confined largely to stimulating the production of chicha. In short, the Cubeo headman gives all of his effort and ability to the community. The community, for its part, has no obligation to give anything to him. Since he has no authority to command economic productivity, for he is not an economic redistributor, he is devoid of significant economic function. At the same time the headman is a secular figure; he has no greater magical or religious powers than any other and so he is lacking in sacred authority. He may be a war leader, but he need not be; and even when he is a war leader, it is a very small party that he commands. Thus, [Page 152] the Cubeo headman is lacking in precisely those attributes that in other parts of the world have traditionally played a prominent part in political evolution."																															1154	No	"The two terms, habókü and kenámi upákü, meaning, respectively, a man of substance and “owner of the house,” illustrate the conceptual range in Cubeo leadership. The habókü is the leader, whose presence, enhanced by a muscular physique, commands respect, who has undisputed skill in hunting, in fishing, in crafts, and who commands ceremonial lore. He possesses the full range of ceremonial regalia, feather headdresses, necklaces, and girdles. His equipment is of the best quality and in excellent condition. The kenámi upákü, on the other hand, is simply the head of the maloca. The habókü is apt to be head of the house, but a house head need not be habókü, although as a leader he will possess some habókü attributes. Thus not all headmen qualify as habókü . Those of higher-ranking sibs, such as the Órabawa, Aúnbwawü, and Hehénewa, usually do, and those of lower-ranking sibs, such as the Bahúkiwa, usually do not. The existence of a concept of habókü is a spur to the ambition of a headman, although the status is honorific only. The habókü commands respect everywhere in the tribe, but his authority, such as it is, is limited to his own sib. Sibmen share in the prestige of having a habókü as headman. Not every habókü is the head of his sib, for in some sibs several men hold the title and their senior is then the headman. In time of war the habókü is the natural war leader. Even when not headman his leadership is drawn upon in hunting and in all collective activities."																															1155	No	"Within the sib, the headman is the firm but gentle father, ever watchful of the welfare of his sibmates. There is, however, another side to the office. As representative of the sib within the phratry he is the organizer of drinking parties in which the prestige of the sib and his own prestige are involved. An ambitious headman urges his people to produce more chicha, to entertain often. His pressure may become burdensome on the people and his influence within the sib is, accordingly, jeopardized. The habókü with more commanding presence can push people father, it is said, than the ordinary kenámi upákü . While drinking parties are enjoyed and sibs are conscious of their own heightened prestige as givers of chicha, they suspect that their headman is pushing himself forward too strongly and they resent it. To forestall such resentment a headman urges household heads to join as cosponsors of a drinking party."																															1156	No	"The headman is charged with preserving the unity of the sib. While concern with personal prestige is not lacking, this consideration of his must be secondary to the welfare of the sib. He must prevent splitting of the sib. If a household leaves, the headman is blamed. He is blamed if sibmen’s quarrels reach a dangerous point. When drinking parties erupt in violence the women taunt the headman with his inability to restore order. Yet in asserting leadership the headman dare not be too forceful. Father Giacone has observed about the Tucano Indians that they are docile. The same can be said of the Cubeo. A man will not, in fact he claims he cannot, resist a direct command. He will obey and be resentful. No householder who had unwillingly submitted to a headman’s command would long remain in the sib. Moreover, the Cubeo do not easily tolerate social tension. If the atmosphere in the house becomes unpleasant someone will certainly move out. Men will not work, hunt, fish, or join in any collective undertaking if the atmosphere is not cordial. Maintaining this atmosphere is perhaps the most difficult charge upon the headman."																															1157	No	"Fighting is the most common social disturbance and is inevitable during a drinking party. A quarrel between two men draws in others, usually close kin; each man entering the fray loudly proclaims his reason for joining, justifying by anger his right to take part. Members of the same household always have justifiable cause for anger in assisting one another. More distant kin must cite a personal motive. They can claim a past insult. A host or headman is privileged to intervene to stop a fight but will do so reluctantly. In a Cubeo quarrel the detached bystander is not welcome. Women are usually strongly disturbed by fighting. They dread that someone will get hurt and when a fracas becomes bloody they loudly demand that the headman put a stop to it. If he ignores them, pretending to be drowsy with drink, they abuse him and say he is not fit to be a headman. "																															1158	No	"To determine the guilty sorcerer an inquest is held around the hammock of the ill person, or of the deceased, as the case may be. All residents of the maloca gather and wait for the members of the victim’s household to make the first charge. The charge is made and evidence is cited in terms of motive and of opportunity. The charge is either corroborated or refuted by any adult in the house, other names are mentioned, and the evidence is sifted. The entire discussion is conducted in a loud and angry tone of voice, and arms are brandished menacingly. Again, we are dealing with the principle that a serious accusation can be made only in anger. The role of the medicine man in the inquest is usually limited to stating his diagnosis of sorcery. He may offer a clue that the sorcerer is a man from afar or nearby but rarely does he name the culprit. The headman is usually the last to enter the discussion. He reviews all the evidence and presents his own verdict, which usually is, but need not be, accepted. After guilt has been established in this way, they decide how to act. It is not considered necessary to ask the accused if he can refute the charges."																															1159	No	"The construction, as in the case of the open maloka , is carried out by all the men of the tribe, under the direction of the chief, as communal work. "																															1161	No	"These safety measures are necessary, for one must always be prepared for a hostile attack. That is why the 61 women carry all the household goods, for if the men were thus burdened, they could not defend themselves. For this reason, the chief and his brothers always march in the middle of the tribe, for in the event of a military encounter the protection of the chief is the supreme command of all the Surára. He is honored and respected, of course, not only as the head of the tribe, but also because he is the adviser in all situations of life, the medicine man who is able to make connections with the hekurá and serras /sierras/ (see pp. 200/201) and can ward off sickness and misfortune. If he were killed, the tribe would suddenly be in a terrible situation, for his successor does not yet have the same experience."																															1162	No	"If the hunter has killed a small animal, he may keep this booty for himself and his family, but he often gives the chief a roasted or boiled piece of it. A big-game animal, on the other hand, is divided up under the chief's supervision, and each family gets a piece of meat. This communal feeling is very strongly marked, and no member of the tribe would ever violate it."																															1163	No	"Besides shamans, of which there are several in every village, there are influential ‘big men.’ The number of big men in a village depends, on the one hand, on the size of the village and the number of local patrilineages comprising it, and, on the other, on the number of men who are personally qualified to lead. The qualities that determine leadership are personal courage, fierceness, the ability to be outraged by even the slightest insult, marksmanship, diplomacy in trading with representatives from other villages, the ability to arrange marriages for male supporters with females from other villages, cunning and intelligence in dealings with allies, the ability to attract young men to live permanently in the village by promising them wives, and the defense of group members who get into difficulties with other village members."																															1164	No	"Individuals who possess all these attributes are considered leaders only if they have a large natural following, i.e., brothers and sons living with them in their village. Otherwise, such men have only just a little more [Page 44] influence within the village. A leader's functions are few and ill-defined. Generally, he initiates activities that the entire group has already decided to undertake. His major function and concern is with organizing and leading raiding parties and with investigating the village neighborhood when raiders are likely to be present, a dangerous and undesirable task. Moreover, he represents the village and frequently initiates feasts to honor other villages, and he often supervises the trading that normally follows a feast, permitting enough possessions to pass into the hands of the guests to assuage their greed, while at the same time ensuring that his followers are not impoverished. Because of his role in initiating feasts, his garden is usually larger than that of his followers and he produces the greater portion of food given away during the feast. During club-fights within the village, the leaders of the factions involved in the fighting stand by and attempt to keep the fighting innocuous, using both diplomacy and threats to effect a relatively peaceful end to the fighting. When diplomacy fails and someone is badly injured or killed in the fighting, the headmen are the first to start firing arrows at the offenders."																															1165	No	"The headman's role as leader is enhanced in proportion to the intensity of warfare. Some headmen deliberately seek to prolong wars by spurning offers of peace from their enemies, or go so far as to initiate new raids against some unsuspecting village on the pretext that they are practicing harmful magic against his followers, or simply to abduct women."																															1166	No	"The emergence of Paruriwä as an important leader was largely the result of his active prosecution of the war against the Patanowä-tedi. Kaobäwä, after he led one revenge raid against the Patanowä-tedi, decided that he wanted to remain neutral in the fighting and wanted to make peace with the Patanowä-tedi. This led to a political vacuum within [Page 185] Bisaasi-tedi, as the Monou-tedi were demanding military aid from them. Paruriwä seized upon this as his opportunity to advance his prestige, and after the middle of 1965 initiated several raids against the Patanowä-tedi without the support of Kaobäwä. This enhanced his prestige with the Monou-tedi. As Paruriwä was not related to the slain Monou-tedi headman (consanguineally), his participation in the war is best seen as an expression of his attempt to advance his status."																															1167	No	"Rerebawä is perhaps more typical than Ka aobawä in the sense that he is concerned about his reputation for ferocity and goes out of his way to act tough. He is, however, much braver than the other men his age and backs up his threats with action. Moreover, he is concerned about politics and knows the details of intervillage relationships over a large area. In this respect he shows all the attributes of a headman, although he is still too young and has too many competent older brothers in his own village to expect to move easily into the position of leadership there."																															1168	No	"Each man clears his own land. Brothers will usually clear adjacent portions of land and, if their father is still living, his garden will be among theirs. The headman of the village generally has the largest garden, as he must produce larger quantities of food; he is obliged to give food away at feasts. He can frequently enlist the aid of other men to help him make a large garden. Ka aobawä, for example, is helped by a younger brother, a brother-in-law, and the latter's son. Once in a while one of his sisters who lives in a different village visits for a long stretch of time, and her son-in-law also helps Ka aobawä work in the garden during these visits."																															1169	No	"Ka aobawä's personality differs considerably from Paruriwä's. Where the former is unobtrusive, calm, modest, and perceptive, the latter is belligerent, aggressive, ostentatious, and rash. Ka aobawä has an established status in the village and numerous supporters, whose loyalties are in part determined by their kinship ties and in part because he is a wise leader. Paruriwä is attempting to share in the leadership and does not have a well-established position in this respect. It is obvious who the real leader is: When visitors come to Upper Bisaasi-teri, they seek out Ka aobawä and deal with him, no matter how ambitiously Paruriwä attempts to emulate his position. Paruriwä does not have as many living brothers in his group as Ka aobawä has, so his “natural following” is somewhat limited."																															1170	No	"The village headman is the dominant political leader and comes from the largest local patrilineage. When a village is large or when two local descent groups are approximately equal in size, a village may have several headmen. To lead, the headman must rely on demonstrated skills in settling disputes, representing the interests of his lineage, and successfully dealing with allies and enemies. Styles of leadership vary; some headmen lead through practiced verbal skills while others resort to bullying tactics. Concerted action requires the consensus of adult males. However, an individual is free not to participate in collective action if it suits him."																															1171	No	"In their communities they are closely connected to each other and they are lavish with friendship and mutual aid toward each other; they respect the capacity, initiative, and intelligence of any of their components and those attributes cause him to be considered as a leader of the paracalidad . On the other hand, they punish what are for them the three serious faults: laziness, robbery, and adultery. For tobbery they apply direct corporal punishment if the stolen object is of great importance; after the anction imposed by them they take the delinquent before the civil authorities; if the chief repeats the offence several times, they try to expel him from their midst if this is not possible they shun him completely and no one has any kind of relations with him, by which means they compel him to live in complete ostracism by himself. Laziness and adultery they punish with contempt; they make no fuss or argument; they simply ignore those who are at fault."																															1172	No	"The political authorities are named by the government, but although they hold authority their power is small. They can be considered as simple mouthpieces of the higher authorities, who through them try to impose legal orders, but frequently they serve to develop arbitrary and capricious ones, including abuses that owners of latifundios or authorities attempt to impose on the parcialidad . In this way the political leaders in the parcialidades have become simple instruments of higher authorities, for which reason they do not enjoy the respect and esteem of their neighbors. These personages are recognized by their dress and the symbols they carry; they always go about covered with their black ponchos and carry in the hand the symbol of authority that is represented by an enormous whip, the stock of which is covered or ornamented with metal; this expression and symbolization of authority is probably unique in the world."																															1173	No	"/267/ Respect within the community is earned progressively, whether through age, or by being considered depositories of supernatural powers, or by being recognized as more intelligent; but to reach these notable positions or seats of eminence it is necessary for them to have held the alferezship , or having financed a religious festival; until this has happened a person cannot be taken into consideration; this is one of the subtle impositions of the clergy to get power over the community. The alferezship lasts from one year to the next; at the end of a celebration the friars nominate the one who will preside the next year and to confirm the matter they give him a distinctive insignia, so that those attending may be informed who is the [Page 95] /267 cont./ chosen person and can help him in his preparations. The person named indicates at the same moment what type of dance will be presented, and in this way the public can have time to be preparing their costumes; simultaneously, with the help of his family, friends, and other members of the community, the man designated starts to make the corresponding preparations, which lead him, in order to please the saint and the village and generously repay the friars, to contract debts which will need many years to cancel. In spite of the protests which are beginning to be heard in many localities, the alferezship still continues to be considered a fundamental step to be able to obtain communal respect and from there rise to the leadership."																															1174	No	"It is therefore not surprising that the cargo system and political influence are closely correlated, even though, contrary to other communities on the altiplano, the fiesta hierarchy and the political hierarchy are not systematically interlinked. For instance, having assumed leadership positions in the community is not a sufficient basis for prestige. A leader's position must be validated by previous or subsequent fiesta sponsorship. Also, fiesta participation is required of all leaders in the sense that at least one section authority should be present at all life crisis celebrations and should sit at the section's site on the plaza during saint's fiestas. On all these occasions he is expected to provide more alcohol than other nonsponsoring participants."																															1175	No	"The ruler of each Aymara state was distinguished by a number of privileges. Each ayllu reserved certain lands ( suwu which were farmed communally for his support; in fact, these lands survived well into Republican times, when they were worked to support the Spanish governors. The chief was polygynous, possessed servants, wore [Page 539] special dress and ornaments, was carried about in a litter, and had an exceptionally elaborate household. He was given special burial."																															1176	No	"Nor does great prestige derive from leadership, for leadership patterns are poorly developed in the contemporary Aymara society of Chucuito. As stated earlier, all high and important political offices in the town and District are held by Mestizos, with the result that power and authority tend to be a special prerogative of this “caste.” The principal political office available to Indians today is that of hilaqata , or head man of an ayllu, and the corresponding office of Maestro Mayor ( barrio leader) in the town proper. It is clear from the writings of Bertonio that the office of hilaqata is ancient and that the holding of office was honorable and rewarding in Colonial Aymara society. 2 At the present time, however, the status of hilaqata has been so debased that individuals are extremely reluctant to hold office and actually do their utmost to evade this responsibility. 3 Yet other contexts suggest that the assumption of leadership and the holding of office are somehow distasteful to the Aymara. The various statuses of guía , or “dance leader,” are filled only after considerable [Page [p. 169 b]] cajoling and persuasion by the group members, and fiestas are often uncelebrated because no one is willing to perform the role of alférez , or “sponsor.” Leadership per se , therefore, appears to carry little prestige; rather, as is shown below, leadership in public affairs has become in large part dependent upon and symbolic of wealth."																															1177	No	"It is pointed out above that it is difficult to know whether the playing of a particular role (i.e., that of magician) has modified the personalities of the individuals who occupy this status or, with appropriate personality trends already set, these men were initially attracted to the status because it was congenial to them. In the cases analyzed, evidence of some general predisposition was detected on the part of individuals who eventually became magicians. It should be apparent from the foregoing discussion, however, that in Chucuito no special, atypical personality traits are required of the magician in the performance of his role. Instead, the pattern assemblage magic is so geared to the personality characteristics of the average Aymara that a submissive, dependent, irresolute individual, unfamiliar with decisive action and the burden of responsibility, may become a leader and a guiding force, in short, a power, in his society."																															1178	No	"The Bororo spoke to me of such cases of bigamy, which is confirmed by the following observation by Karl von den Steinen ( o.c. , p. 501): “In Thereza Christina, apparently only Moguyokuri (the chief) lived in polygamy. His wives were a woman of a certain age and a daughter of her first marriage; he married a widow who had a daughter, and when the mother became ugly and the daughter became pretty, he “married” the daughter also.”"																															1179	No	"The chiefs have numerous attributions; we noted the following:1) They are the ones who decide when and to where the aldeia must be moved, the place for the maloca /house for several families/ of each clan, in order to preserve the ancient customs.2) They are the ones who during the funeral rites [Page 234] 137 cont. impose the ba on the pubescent youths, who with this ceremony are removed from the number of little boys, freed from the protection of the mother, and introduced into the company of the men, being able to hunt, to fish, to take an active part in the religious dances and rites, see the aige , etc.3) With ritual sentences, the xobuguiu gives permission, or better, gives the order for the collective hunting or fishing to be done, while the xebeguiu orders the preparation of the meal which must precede both. It is the aroettawaraare , however, who presides over the song kie paru or kiegue baregue, which is sung on the night before the hunt.138 4) They direct the religious ceremonies on the occasion of the death of an Indian; the bari does not intervene officially as bari in the funeral ceremonies.5) They set up the theatrical representations of the aroe and the national dances in various circumstances.6) They take their subjects to war.7) They see to it that the tribal traditions are preserved and reprehend those who violate them.8) They govern paternally, communicating in public every night what must be done the following day.9) They receive and send messengers to other aldeias, looking for news which might interest their subjects.10) They regulate the relations between the Indians and the white men, although cursorily."																															1180	No	"It is interesting to transcribe an estimation that Akirio Boróro Keggeu -- Tiago -- wrote concerning the former chief of the boróros , Ukeiuwaguuo , in these literal terms: Ukeiwaguuo / sic / was not of the family of the Badogebague nor of other Exerae . He belonged only to the family of the Paiwoe , which is the poorest of the Orarimogodogue. He was only a tugaboeigare , that is, he was a brave man. He was humble and quiet; all the things that were asked of him, he would give without words and with pleasant and kind gestures; finally he was kind and generous. For this reason everyone obeyed him and respected him."																															1181	No	"That knowledge is highly valued among the Bororo is substantiated by the fact that the chief of a village is always the most knowledgeable man. Social status and functions are connected with particular lineages and transmitted matrilineally, but the true influential leaders and authorities are the men who excel in knowoedge; i.e., they know the myths and songs and their meanings; they know the exact sequence of rituals and the important sacred and secret names of things."																															1182	No	"The fact that the principal educator of a boy is his father has far-reaching consequences. Since the Bororo headman, boe eimejera , should be a good hunter, a good fisherman, a good craftsman, and above all an intellectual with great knowledge of tribal traditions, myths, and songs, and since all skills and knowledge are acquired from one's fathers and initiators, the office of headman is not transmitted matrilineally but goes from father to son. One may also become knowledgeable without having a knowledgeable father. He may receive the desired instruction from some other man, but only if he pays the man, i.e., if he gives presents of food in exchange for information. From his matrilineage, from his classificatory brothers, and from his namegiver (if he is one of his brothers) a man will inherit the right to ceremonial performances, names, and songs; but he will not be taught how to perform the ceremonies or how to sing the songs unless he pays his instructors. I quote here the words of a headman, which convey the Bororo thoughts about education:If your father is a knowledgeable man, if he is a chief of the Bororo, he will want you to be like him, to be as knowledgeable as he is. He will will die but you will be here in his place, you will be the chief of the Bororo in his place. With this in mind he instructed you in all these things."																															1183	No	"The chiefs are very influential, but lack coercive authority. They announce in the evening what is to be done on the following day, give marching orders, determine the location of clan huts in the settlement, lead in war, receive messengers, conduct various rites, and generally maintain old usage. But the individual tribesmen retain complete personal freedom, checked only by the vivid fear of disapproval. Even murder, instead of being punished, merely evokes a feud."																															1184	No	"Tupí-Guaraní chiefdoms were pyramidal structures of power based upon patrilineal inheritance of chiefly status. Ritual powers were distributed according to individuals’ abilities to demonstrate shamanistic “gifts,” or chants, that indicated the presence of auxiliary spirits and conferred the ability to lead collective dances in sacred rituals and ceremonies. Among the Apapocuva-Guaraní, for example, Nimuendajú found that individuals were ranked into a ritual hierarchy consisting of four levels: (1) children and those few adults who had no chant; (2) the majority of adult men and women who had one or two chants and who could potentially lead collective dances; (3) male and female shamans who had numerous chants and who could use these powers for curing illnesses and other purposes; and (4) senior males who were great shamans capable of leading the most sacred ceremony, or Nimongarai . 14. Nimuendajú, Los Mitos de Creación .Introduction Go to end note pageThis hierarchy of ritual power trickled through the interstices of the all-male political order of chiefs, elders, and hunter-warriors.Although a fundamental contradiction between political and ritual powers ran through the entire social formation at all levels, the contradiction only erupted into the open when great shamans, or prophets ( karai ), attempted to be chiefs. Such individuals were rare, since they could not succeed in balancing the two kinds of power. The [Page x] story of Obera, a prophet and chief who attempted to lead a massive uprising against the Spaniards in 1579, demonstrates the impossibility of simultaneously exercising ritual and political powers. Obera’s uprising failed when local chiefs withdrew their support because they could not allow him to make such a major political decision (i.e., to oppose the Spaniards) for their own political provinces."																															1185	No	"Tupí and Guaraní villages consisted of several communal houses (often four, sometimes eight), built around a central space. According to Evreux, two persons shared the power in each village: a mburubicha (chief) and a pagy-ouassou (great shaman). The great shamans were those carrying the title of karai (caraiva, caraïbe, depending on the text). All paje did not enjoy a similar prestige, and Evreux distinguishes three categories: “You find very trifling ones, and they are not thought of very highly, they are hardly feared, and their trade is not worth much to them. There are others, a little more knowledgeable, [Page 28] in the middle, between the small and great [shamans]; they usually hold shop in each of their tributary villages . . . taking care of dances and other matters dependent upon their services.” Finally come the great shamans; they “are the most respected after the Chiefs, and even the Chiefs speak to them with reverence.” 69. Ibid., 287.Go to end note pageTheir fame extended far beyond the village: “Whereas Barbers of small and middle influence have some authority among their own people, those who are properly named Pagy-Ouassou, great Barbers, have much more; they are the Sovereigns of a Province, greatly feared and dreaded, and they arrived at such authority by much shrewdness.” 70"																															1186	No	"Other features of the behavior of the karai are less easy to reconcile with certain well-documented expectations. For instance, ascetic practices (fasting and swallowing tobacco smoke, subsisting on wild plants, in the form, among others, of fermented drinks, while refusing all meat, and so on) are not in keeping with the substantial offerings of food or valuable objects often demanded by the karai, so we are told, in the villages through which they were passing. They inspired such fear that the villagers did not dare to refuse them anything, and numerous witnesses state that they showed no reluctance about taking such an advantage. Some authors speak of them as they would of tyrants. They could even demand wives, and did not fail to do so: several of them were polygamous, like the chiefs, and one of them had nearly forty wives, a number never attained even by the most notorious chiefs. Their fortune, their polygamy, are enough to bring them close to the status of chiefs. And here we face a contradiction: some karai actually were the chiefs of a province. Yet the status of chief is incompatible with that of karai . Those who held both offices were probably few, especially in the sixteenth century; there might not have been any before the Conquest. Nevertheless, there were some in the seventeenth century, Pacamont for example. Their sphere of authority must have been increased as a result of holding these two kinds of power, but then these could no longer be held in balance: religious power was necessarily subordinated to political power. To be a chief meant ceasing to be a complete prophet, or more exactly, the karai kept prestige and power, but lost the special status. A chief did not have, and could not have, the privilege of “free transit” through provinces hostile to each other, since he decided upon war expeditions and was the one through whom communities defined themselves as friends or enemies. He obviously could not be outside political alliances, being precisely the one who embodied them. Nor could he be outside the community, since he directed its affairs, nor outside the network of kinship. A chief always held a position [Page 36] that could be located in space and in time, because being chief meant primarily belonging to a privileged lineage (chieftaincy was hereditary); it meant governing a village and residing there. Consequently, when prophets acceded to the chieftaincy, the ambiguity inherent in the character of the karai as god-men was carried to the extreme, that is, to a contradiction."																															1188	No	"Chiefdoms were hereditary offices passed on from the father to the son. In the absence of a son, the position went to a brother or other male relative. A tuvich[unknown]a was expected to be generous and was responsible for keeping the peace through moderating disputes, gift-giving, and forming marriage alliances. By virtue of the shaman’s link with the spiritual world and their performances in ritual dances and songs, these medicine men enjoyed special status in society. 16Anthony F.C. Wallace, Religion: An Anthropological View (New York: Random House, 1966), 56.Since medicine men were often the most influential individuals in tribal society, many chiefs became shamans in order to increase their power among their people. 17"																															1189	No	"All Apapocuva-Guaraní chiefs, for at least a hundred years, have been shamans who have reached the highest rank within their profession. Like the ancient chiefs, they have been credited with supernatural power and with miracles performed on behalf of their people."																															1190	No	"A Guaraní chief was succeeded by his eldest son unless there was some stronger member of the family. However, an eloquent man distinguished in warfare might become chief. Persons dissatisfied with their headman might secede and start a new settlement under another leader. Chiefs of Cainguá communities in Paraguay have a Spanish title and carry a stick as symbol of their office. Fifty years ago, a few villages were administered as in Jesuit times, by a cacique mayor and cacique menor, a sargento, and [Page 86] a cabo (Vogt, 1904, p. 203). Today the number of Indians under the authority of a chief vary from 20 to about 100."																															1191	No	"The members of the ancient Guaraní communities built the houses of their chiefs and tilled their fields and harvested their crops (Ruíz de Montoya, 1892, p. 49)."																															1192	No	"Child betrothal is reported among modern Cainguá, but the girls remain with their parents, who receive presents from their prospective sons-in-law. The preferred form of marriage seems to have been between cross-cousins and between a maternal uncle and his niece. Union with a mother and her daughter and sororal polygyny can be inferred from allusions in the Jesuitic literature. Only chiefs and influential shamans seem to have been able to support several wives. Some powerful caciques are said to have had from 15 to 30 wives. The levirate is stated by Ruiz de Montoya (1892, p. 49) to have been observed by chiefs. Today residence is patrilocal."																															1193	No	"This leadership role in kin groups is one that individuals assume over their descendants and cognates, not an office in a bureaucratic hierarchy. This position remains informal and poorly defined, in part because it wields little power over the group or its resources. Kin leaders exercise influence acquired not through force, but through respect based on wisdom ( marandú ) and religious understanding. In contrast to a position of power founded on control over juniors’ rights in land, women, or children, influence derives from a leader’s showing an understanding of tekó marangatú, a moral aspect of social behavior that emphasizes respect for and understanding of others. (Translations here are my own.)"																															1194	No	"Ñembo’é is the primary arena for the tamoí to exercise his leadership. As a mediator between the worldly and supernatural realms and between each individual and the deities, and as a diviner of the end of the earth, he establishes himself as leader of his people. The attendance at the ñembo’é evinces the extent of influence of a tamoí in a community. Large groups are garnered by those tamoí who command respect for the importance of their visions. Lesser tamoí may only exert influence over a few close kin.These activities and ideas reinforce bonds between families and reaffirm the group’s Chiripá identity. First, the religious leader emphasizes the unity of the group. By physically mediating relations between the community and the supernatural, he reinforces his role as the central point around which the dispersed families congregate. In being called grandfather, he assumes the role of progenitor of all members, symbolizing the real and fictive kin relations that join them as a community."																															1196	No	"There he was only called the staff for the people, widows and orphans of the chief ( alakalyi ) Tininti” ( 122, 3). “In former times wherever there were priests and leaders ( mámakuei alakályikuei ) of the Kágaba, Master ( alakalyi ) Muluku ( 3 ) sent them the priestly words ( muligeba mámakue[unknown]it[unknown]si , actually, the words of the priests)” ( 56 , 4). This therefore expresses the fact that 54 the leaders ( alakályikue[unknown]i ) were at the same time priests, and the same is to be understood when Aluetsama is called “the mother of the authorities, priests, and old women” ( alakalyi mama ué[unknown]i[unknown]zukue[unknown]it[unknown]si hava ) ( 121 , 1)."																															1197	No	"The Kogi live in a complex, ranked society in which priestly and lordly lineages continue to play a major role. However, none of these lineages, membership in which is determined by the principle of parallel descent, are privileged in any way by landholdings, better housing, or other physical advantage. Even the highest-ranking Kogi shares in the subsistence level, wears the same threadbare clothes, and lives in the same small hut as his lower-ranking compatriot. The difference consists in traditional power, in authority, and in the ability to establish rules of correct procedure. Although most Kogi villages have a headman who nominally represents civil authority, the true power of decision in personal and community affairs is concentrated in the hands of the native priesthood. These men, many of whom possess a profound knowledge of astronomy, meteorology, and ecology (Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1977), base their authority, in part, on their continuous intelligent leadership, in part on strong religious principles. Perhaps the most important religious mechanism is confession. Public confession of misbehaviour and offences — in action or intent — constitutes a periodic ritual and the truthfulness of the confessants is guaranteed by priestly threats of illness and impending death. Kogi priests believe that between man and nature exists an equilibrium which might easily be disturbed by irresponsible human action. Although this equilibrium refers not only to subsistence resources, water management, and forest conservation, but also to a spiritual and moral balance of the individual, nevertheless, agricultural rituals occupy a very prominent place in Kogi religion. The repetitive sequence of the major collective rituals is timed according to astronomically-determined seasons; that is, the ritual calendar corresponds to the agricultural cycle. Individual agricultural practices are subject to many ritual rules. It is believed that all native food plants have their other-worldly “fathers” and “mothers” and that crop fertility has to be insured by frequent offerings to these spirit-beings. Soil types (humus, clay, sand, and so on) are ritually named, as are categories of rains, winds, lagoons, and the different cardinal directions with which they are associated. The planting or harvesting of any crop needs a specific “permit” ( sewa ) which only a ‘priest can give and similar permits are required to fell a tree, fire a field, or dig a drainage ditch. These permits consist of small stone beads or other talisman-like objects and their acquisition may be costly, protracted, or may be withheld altogether. The possession of these sewa depends, in part, upon the user’s lineage, and in part, upon priestly approval; each member of a lineage is the “owner” of certain sewa, while the principal priestly lineages are associated with fertility symbols such as water, rain, lagoons, rock crystals, semen, or similar concepts."																															1198	No	"The wikyi’-council was the supreme authority of the wikyi’-group and superior to the niyat, the spokesman. “No chief would dare to impose a decision at variance with the desire of his followers. He generally finds out the wishes of the majority by listening to conversations and then carries the matter through as if it were his own idea” (Métraux 1946:303)."																															1199	No	"The traditional Mataco leader of the wikyi’ or the band was called niyat . This is translated by the word “chief” by most of the scholars (cf. Métraux 1946:303; Fock 1982:25; and others). He was not a chief with coercive power, however, but functioned as a spokesman or a speaker at a Western parliament. As his primary function was to speak for the others, to pronounce their will, and, if necessary, see to it that their decisions were carried out, I prefer to translate niyat by the English “spokesman”."																															1200	No	"The position as niyat is not hereditary, in the literal sense of the word (Métraux 1946:303). But as he represents one of the most influential families of the village, it is not uncommon that his successor comes from the same family and even the same family group. Here, “influential” denotes a family group whose members are reknown for eloquence and generosity, for taking initiatives to /successful/ hunting or fishing expeditions, for their ability to summon a large following if a conflict arises. Because of this /sometimes permanent/ connection between a leading family and the village leader, it is easy to conceive of the institution as hereditary, as some scholars have done (e.g. Nordenskiöld 1926:35; 1912:181)."																															1201	No	"The compensation for this duty is of doubtful value. The niyat has to forage, fish and hunt, just as the other villagers. He has no honorary seat at parties or at church festivals. His hut is not different from those of his neighbours (Nordenskiöld 1926:34—35). He receives no payment for his work. Instead, he is supposed to care for the welfare of his people, sometimes to the extent that he becomes the poorest man of the village (Métraux 1946:303), as he has got to share all acquisitions with his fellow villagers [Page 132] (Jespersson 1943:93). If he disappoints his followers, they may repudiate him and choose a new leader."																															1202	No	"His reward consists of a vaguely higher status than the others. This constitutes such a questionable asset, however, that if there is no “born leader” in the village, who takes a delight in the niyat tasks, it may be difficult to find someone who is willing to assume the office 103. This was the case in Algarrobal, after the death of the great niyat Enetseis in 1980. Still in 1985, no good solution had been found, as nobody wanted to be the spokesman of the village."																															1203	No	"The Mataco are monogamous. There are very few examples of men with two or three wives, and then it was always a matter of chiefs. The polygyny of chiefs is probably an ancient custom, as it is sanctioned in the account about the first appearance of woman. "																															1204	No	"Social ranks and classes in the strict sense of the words do not exist among the Tobas, just as they are unknown to the Avas; but we can trace the germ of a nobility in the fact that the sons and descendants of a great cacique or war chief generally enjoy greater esteem than other members of the society. The chiefs have power to command, especially in times of war, when their orders are unfailingly obeyed. They distingush themselves from the rest of their people by having several wives and often by being richer, since of the spoils taken in war the main part is allotted to them. Formerly they also distingushed themselves externally from other men by a peculiar arrangement of the hair. According to the Catholic missionaries Dobrizhoffer and Charlevoix, 1) Dobrizhoffer, An Account of the Abipones, II. 17. Charlevoix, Historia del Paraguay, I. 135.) all Guaycuru tribes used to pluck out the hair from the forehead to the crown of the head so that the forepart was bald. This arrangement, which had magic significance, was called nalemrá, and was the reason why the Tobas were called by the Spaniards [Page 46] Frentones. But Dobrizhoffer adds that among the Abipones — who were only a particular Toba tribe — the nalemrá of a chief was made much larger than that of other people, a broad bald path being made from the forehead to the back of the head. These distinguishing marks are unknown to the present day Toba chiefs."																															1205	No	"The dignity of the chief is as a rule hereditary; the eldest son of a cacique generally succeeds his father as leader of the tribe, except when he is born of a woman whom the chief has divorced. But although a Toba may inherit the chieftainship from his father, he must always display certain prominent qualities to be approved of by his people. These qualities are valour, skill, and experience in making war, as well as intelligence and eloquence. The warlike qualities, of course, are most appreciated. If a chief falls short in this respect and shows himself useless and cowardly in a war, he is removed by his people, or more strictly speaking, by the Council of the Eldest, in spite of all the merits which his father may have possessed."																															1206	No	"The Council of the Eldest just mentioned shows in its way the developed organization of the Toba society. This Council consists of the eldest men from each sub-tribe and is therefore called Eakac[unknown]hi ([unknown]The Old Ones[unknown]). ¸Now it is customary among all Chaco tribes that the eldest men or the heads of the different families assemble to deliberate the common affairs of the tribe, but it is only among the Tobas that these old family fathers form an organized body with definite functions. If a chief shows himself cowardly or treats his people badly, the Council of the Eakachi penalise him and remove him from the leadership. Thus the great chief Taycolique had, just at the time when I arrived at the Pilcomayo, been removed from his position as chief because, as the Tobas told me, he was addicted to drunkenness and when drunk had repeatedly committed outrages against, and even killed, some of his own people. Still Taycolique to a remarkable degree possessed the [Page 47]Choroti Indians outside their house.The open space in the middle of the Choroti village, with a drum placed to the left.

The scene to the right illustrates the Indian custom of louse-eating.[Page 49] very qualities which the Indians appreciate in their leaders. He was valiant, cunning, and eloquent, and, being a great warrior, had provided his people with firearms which made the Tobas superior in war to all other Chaco tribes and dangerous enemies even to the whites."																															1207	No	"Aggressiveness finds another outlet in drinking bouts. Fights are so intimately associated with these alcoholic enjoyments that, before a party begins, the chief gives a long talk in which he exhorts the men to refrain from violence and to have a good time in peace and harmony. When the men begin to get inebriated the women conceal the weapons in the bush. Despite these precautions, quarrels and fights are rather common. Men remember slights and insults delivered months-before and belatedly challenge the offender. Threats are exchanged and hard words are followed by acts of violence."																															1208	No	"The Chiriguano chiefs, however, have a privilege, which is that they cannot be rejected by the women of their choice: this is a great stroke of luck for them. The chief reveals his inclination with the offering of a piece of meat or some other thing; the girl cooks it, and they then share both meal and bed. The chiefs, especially the [Page 81] generals, that is the ones who have several camps under their command, have at least one wife in each camp."																															1209	No	"The general chiefs are chosen at second remove, that is, from among the subordinate chiefs, who, in turn, are elected by the people. Normally a marked preference is shown for the late chief’s sons, provided they be of age, courageous and good. But then, of course, we must say that in these elections the same passions are present which appear amongst us in our elections."																															1210	No	"The chiefs have the place of honour in the thickest of the battle, which always results in the death of some of them. If the invaders win, they sack everything, capture the women, the children and cattle, parcel out the booty and set fire to the village."																															1211	No	"Each of these localized families or kinship groups recognized the moral leadership of one of the elder men. He could hardly be called chief. He had no real authority. The office was in no sense hereditary. He would not have to be a shaman. He was well versed in tribal traditions and customary law, and spoke often of them. His influence was persuasive, not coercive. For acceptance of his counsels he counted on the general respect for elders and for established customs. The members of the localized extended families had mutual loyalty, and clung together particularly in revenge expeditions and feuds."																															1212	No	"Though there is no supreme leadership that would hold together all the Selk'nam people, one finds instead in every larger family group an aged man, the k[unknown] m[unknown] l , who, without an express commission and without hereditary appointment, to a certain extent has the guidance of those around him in his hands, and, to be sure, on the basis of his advanced age and mature judgment, his honorable conduct and the confidence that is universally placed in him. His position of leading power is, in the long run, only a moral superiority that has developed out of an irreproachable conduct of life, personal efficiency, and well-earned prestige. This head knows the ancient tradition and ancestral customs well; he often speaks [Page 599] 422 cont. of them and points to them when impetuous youth seems to deviate from them. His advanced age gives him the right to criticize the mistakes and lapses of those around him."																															1213	No	"The head influences others more by cautioning and admonishing them, rather than by threatening and upbraiding them. To be sure, he has no means of punishment at his disposal, but, much more effectively, he awakens the sense of honor and points out the danger for the good name of the individual himself as well as of the whole kin group. Thus he becomes the bearer and guardian of tradition, an ordering and regulating force for all of tribal life. Not a single younger person would dare to oppose for any length of time the very rare admonitions or the justified disapproval of this old leader without becoming generally despised. Most people feel that to be in bad repute in public is the severest punishment. For this reason everyone submits when the k[unknown] m[unknown] l gives good advice, when he settles disputes, when he mediates between two hostile groups. If there is danger of war, 423 his opinion is often sought; one follows his judgment in moving the camp, in communal hunts, in calling many together for competitive events or for the Kloketen celebration. His decision is never legally binding, to be sure, but it has strong moral force; the old man enjoys the particular advantage of having his wish heeded because he himself sets the best example by his irreproachable conduct and respectful persistence in the old traditions."
